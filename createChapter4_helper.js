### Shared Responsibility

Spicetimeâ€™s governance focuses on:
1. **Fair Decision-Making**:
   - All voices matter, and proposals are voted on democratically.
2. **Transparency and Trust**:
   - Decisions, metrics, and processes are publicly available for review.`,

    "decentralized_governance.md": `# Decentralized Governance

Spicetime builds **trustless ecosystems**, enabling autonomous governance mechanisms where decisions are executed programmatically through:

1. **Smart Contracts**:
   - Automatically execute rules without any single party holding control.
2. **Distributed Consensus**:
   - Ensure fairness by leveraging tools like global token-weighted voting systems.`,

    "ethical_ai_autonomous_decision.md": `# Ethical AI in Decision-Making

Spicetime employs ethical AI that:
- Avoids discrimination.
- Allows explainable decision processes for transparency.
- Improves based on **diverse feedback loops**.

AI is always accountable, ensuring fairness for all system decisions.`
