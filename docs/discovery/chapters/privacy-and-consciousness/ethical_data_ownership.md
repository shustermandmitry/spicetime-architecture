# Ethics of Data Ownership

Spicetime redefines how users interact with their data by adopting principles of **ethical ownership**, ensuring that:

1. **Users are the sole owners of their data**: Spicetime does not harvest or store data beyond the user's control.
2. **Granular Permissions**: You decide which apps or collaborators can access your data, and these settings can be changed instantly.
3. **No Monetization Without Consent**: Data will never be sold, shared, or analyzed for profit without explicit user agreement.

By fostering an ecosystem where ethics drive decisions, Spicetime ensures every individual feels secure, respected, and autonomous.
