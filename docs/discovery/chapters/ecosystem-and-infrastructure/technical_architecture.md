# Technical Architecture

The Spicetime infrastructure is built with cutting-edge technologies:

1. **Distributed Systems**:
   - The core services run on a global network for maximum uptime.
2. **API-Driven Connectivity**:
   - An open API ecosystem means developers can plug-and-play their tools into Spicetime seamlessly.
3. **Modular Design**:
   - Each app works independently while improving the greater ecosystem.
