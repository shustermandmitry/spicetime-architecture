# Modular Integration

### A Seamless Ecosystem

Spicetime’s Dream Apps work as standalone modules but thrive when integrated into a **unified workflow**. Here's how:

1. **Shared Data**:
    - Ideas created in DreamScaper can be built upon in DreamCatcher and finalized in DreamWeaver.

2. **API-Friendly Design**:
    - External tools can communicate with Dream Apps, making them compatible with various tech stacks.

3. **Collaborative Harmony**:
    - The tools simplify teamwork across networks, eliminating workflow friction.

Integration means that every part of your dream creation journey works together—perfectly aligned.
