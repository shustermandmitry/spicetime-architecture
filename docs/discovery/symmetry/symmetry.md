# Transaction Symmetry and Redistribution

### Purpose
- Maintain and/or override natural balance in economic systems.  

### Emergent Symmetry
- The natural split of transactions aligns:
  1. "One for me" (individual).  
  2. "One for you" (transaction cost).  
  3. "One for the community" (tax/reinvestment).  

### Controlling Wealth Gravity
- Redistribution ensures wealth neither becomes too concentrated nor too dispersed.  
- Communities can adjust this balance dynamically.
