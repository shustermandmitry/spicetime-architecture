# TypeDoc Configuration Guide

## Overview

This document explains how to set up and configure **TypeDoc** to document a TypeScript-based project. It focuses on defining and organizing TypeDoc configuration to generate structured and useful project documentation.

---

## 1. Why Use TypeDoc?

TypeDoc is a powerful tool for automating the creation of documentation from TypeScript codebases. It converts TypeScript source code into well-structured HTML or Markdown documentation and is ideal for:
- Documenting APIs and function libraries.
- Creating onboarding documentation for TypeScript-based projects.
- Automating developer documentation for monorepos or distributed systems.

---

## 2. TypeDoc Configuration Overview

TypeDoc requires a configuration file (`typedoc.json`) that defines options for:
- Source file inclusion patterns.
- Output format (HTML or Markdown).
- TypeScript compilation options (e.g., handling of decorators or custom paths).
- The structure of the generated documentation.

### Key Configuration File: `typedoc.json`

The `typedoc.json` file provides a centralized method to configure your TypeDoc behavior.

### Example of `typedoc.json`

```json
{
  "entryPoints": ["packages/server/src", "packages/client/src", "packages/shared/src"],
  "out": "docs",
  "tsconfig": "./tsconfig.json",
  "exclude": ["**/*.test.ts", "**/node_modules/**"],
  "excludeExternals": true,
  "excludePrivate": true,
  "includeVersion": true,
  "readme": "README.md",
  "plugin": ["typedoc-plugin-markdown"]
}
```

---

### 3. Key Configuration Parameters

#### 3.1. Entry Points
The `entryPoints` define which parts of your codebase are used to generate documentation. In a monorepo, it's common to include multiple packages as entry points.

**Example:**
```json
"entryPoints": ["packages/server/src", "packages/client/src", "packages/shared/src"]
```

---

#### 3.2. Output Directory
The `out` option specifies the folder where the generated documentation files will be stored.

**Example:**
```json
"out": "docs"
```

---

#### 3.3. TypeScript Config Integration
The `tsconfig` option points to your TypeScript configuration file, ensuring that TypeDoc uses the same compiler settings when processing source files.

**Example:**
```json
"tsconfig": "./tsconfig.json"
```

---

#### 3.4. Exclusions
The `exclude` option allows you to ignore files or folders. For instance, you can exclude unit tests, `node_modules`, or other irrelevant files.

**Example:**
```json
"exclude": ["**/*.test.ts", "**/node_modules/**"]
```

---

#### 3.5. Exclude Private Members
To avoid documenting private APIs, you can use the `excludePrivate` flag.

**Example:**
```json
"excludePrivate": true
```

---

#### 3.6. Plugin Support
TypeDoc supports plugins to extend functionality, like generating Markdown output using the `typedoc-plugin-markdown`.

**Example:**
```json
"plugin": ["typedoc-plugin-markdown"]
```

---

## 4. Best Practices for Configuration

1. Keep your `typedoc.json` in the project root for centralized management.
2. Use `entryPoints` to structure documentation for monorepos by including multiple packages.
3. Exclude non-relevant files or folders to keep your documentation clean.
4. Leverage Markdown plugins to integrate your code documentation into text-based guides.

---

## 5. Summary

By configuring TypeDoc with a well-organized `typedoc.json`, you can ensure that your project documentation is consistent, scalable, and tailored to your monorepo's structure. These settings are foundational to integrating documentation generation seamlessly into the development workflow.
