# Configuration Compound Component: A Vision for Composable Project Structures

## Introduction

The **Configuration Compound Component** is a foundational building block for defining modular and reusable configurations in diverse development ecosystems. It brings together various tools, workflows, environments, and dependencies under a unified, hierarchical structure of child components, allowing for intuitive and dynamic composition of project settings.

This system envisions breaking down configurations into atomic, self-contained components, which can be combined, nested, or overridden based on specific project needs.

---

## Core Vision and Goals

1. **Modularity:**
   - Each component manages a single, well-defined aspect of the project configuration (e.g., build environments, tools, workflows).
   - Atomic configurations can operate independently or participate in larger compositions.

2. **Composability:**
   - Developers can mix, match, and override components to build tailored configurations.
   - Parent components (like `Configuration`) orchestrate these children, forming a compound structure.

3. **Extensibility:**
   - Easy to introduce new tools, domains, or modules into the ecosystem.
   - Supports custom components to extend or modify behavior in any part of the configuration.

4. **Reusability:**
   - Components can be shared and reused across projects for consistent setups.
   - Profiles allow for pre-defined compositions targeting common use cases.

5. **Interoperability:**
   - Supports a variety of tooling ecosystems (e.g., Gatsby, TypeDoc, TurboRepo, GraphQL) while ensuring seamless integration.

## Top-Level Parent Component: `Configuration`

The `Configuration` component is the root of the system. It acts as the parent container and orchestrator for all child components.

### Responsibilities:
- Hold the context for global settings.
- Create a hierarchical structure of child components.
- Define domain-specific environments (e.g., Web, Node.js, GQL).

### Example JSX Representation:
```jsx
import { Gatsby, Typedoc, TurboWorkflow, ConfigDomain, WebBuildEnvironment, NodeBuildEnvironment } from './components';

const MyConfiguration = () => {
    return (
        <Configuration>
            <ConfigDomain name="frontend">
                <WebBuildEnvironment>
                    <Gatsby />
                    <TypedocModule />
                    <TurboTask name="BuildFrontend" />
                </WebBuildEnvironment>
            </ConfigDomain>

            <ConfigDomain name="backend">
                <NodeBuildEnvironment>
                    <TurboWorkflow>
                        <TurboTask name="BuildAPI" />
                        <TurboTask name="RunServer" />
                    </TurboWorkflow>
                    <GQLDocs />
                </NodeBuildEnvironment>
            </ConfigDomain>
        </Configuration>
    );
};

export default MyConfiguration;
```

## Ecosystem of Children Components

Below are the key children components envisioned for this ecosystem and their roles:

### 1. **`ConfigDomain`**
- Represents a logical domain (e.g., `frontend`, `backend`, `documentation`).
- Groups related child components under a common context.

#### Props:
- `name` (string): The name of the domain (e.g., "frontend").
- `dependencies` (array): List of dependencies required for the domain.

---

### 2. **Environment Components**
These components define the build environment for a domain.

#### 2.1 **`BuildEnvironment`**
- Abstract component defining shared behaviors for environments.

#### 2.2 **`WebBuildEnvironment`**
- Specializes `BuildEnvironment` for web-based projects.
- Manages bundlers, static site generators, and front-end tooling.

#### 2.3 **`NodeBuildEnvironment`**
- Specializes `BuildEnvironment` for Node.js applications.
- Handles server-side configurations, runtime builds, and API layers.

---

### 3. **Tool-Specific Components**

#### 3.1 **`Gatsby`**
- Defines the configuration for Gatsby-based static site generation.
- Can embed plugins and themes modularly.

#### Example:
```jsx
<Gatsby plugins={["gatsby-plugin-react-helmet"]} />
```

---

#### 3.2 **`Typedoc`**
- Configures the TypeDoc documentation tool for TypeScript projects.
- Enables auto-documentation generation based on code comments.

#### Example:
```jsx
<Typedoc options={{ out: "./docs", theme: "minimal" }} />
```

---

#### 3.3 **`TurboWorkflow`**
- Orchestrates TurboRepo workflows by defining tasks.
- Acts as the parent for multiple `TurboTask` components.

##### Example:
```jsx
<TurboWorkflow>
    <TurboTask name="Lint" />
    <TurboTask name="Test" />
    <TurboTask name="Build" />
</TurboWorkflow>
```

---

#### 3.4 **`TurboTask`**
- Represents an individual task in a TurboRepo workflow.
- Configurable task dependencies and execution strategies.

##### Props:
- `name`: Name of the task.
- `dependsOn`: An array of task names that this task depends on.

---

#### 3.5 **`TypedocModule`**
- Adds module-level support to the TypeDoc configuration.
- Helps manage configurations for multiple TypeScript packages.

##### Example:
```jsx
<TypedocModule package="packages/utils" />
```

---

#### 3.6 **`GQLDocs`**
- Handles the generation of GraphQL API documentation.
- Automatically outputs documentation using tools like `graphql-docs`.

##### Example:
```jsx
<GQLDocs
    schema="./schemas/schema.graphql"
    output="./docs/graphql-api"
/>
```

---

### 4. **Builder Components**

Builders provide utilities for combining various configurations into a final output.

#### Example: `Builder`
- Aggregates configurations and provides the output JSON or YAML file.

```jsx
<Builder output="./config.json">
    <Configuration>
        <WebBuildEnvironment>
            <Gatsby />
        </WebBuildEnvironment>
    </Configuration>
</Builder>
```

---

### Example Workflow with this System

1. **Define a Domain:**
   - Use `ConfigDomain` to group components for a specific purpose (e.g., `frontend` or `backend`).

2. **Add Environment-Specific Components:**
   - Add child components like `WebBuildEnvironment` or `NodeBuildEnvironment`.

3. **Nest Tools and Modules:**
   - Include tool-specific components (e.g., `Typedoc`, `Gatsby`) as needed.

4. **Aggregate Configurations:**
   - Use the `Builder` component to combine the hierarchy into a single configuration file.

---

## Benefits

1. **Unified, Declarative Approach:**
   - Combines diverse configurations into a single declarative structure.

2. **Scalable by Design:**
   - Child components can be extended or overridden without affecting others.

3. **Improved Collaboration:**
   - Separation of domains (e.g., front-end vs. back-end) enhances team collaboration.

4. **Tooling Agnostic:**
   - Can integrate with any tool or library by extending the component ecosystem.

## Vision for the Future

The **Configuration Compound Component** is a system built for growth. Envisioned to:
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines automatically.
- Support live previews for configuration changes.
- Enable pluggable child components for third-party tools.

This visionary approach ensures a resilient and future-proof framework for managing complex project configurations.
