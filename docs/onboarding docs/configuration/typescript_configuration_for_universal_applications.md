# TypeScript Configuration and Documentation for Universal Applications

## Overview

This document describes the structured approach to organizing TypeScript configurations and documentation for universal applications targeting **Node.js** and **browser** environments. It emphasizes consistency, scalability, and an organized approach to using configurations alongside **documentation strategies** as part of your development workflow.

---

## Documentation Section

This section is focused on understanding the overall **documentation workflow** for this TypeScript architecture. It covers how to approach documenting configuration details, key components, and inter-dependencies for both **developers** and **team onboarding** using tools such as **TypeDoc**.

---

### 1. Goals of Documentation

The goal of documenting your TypeScript architecture is to:
1. Provide **clarity** for how configurations are structured and interact.
2. Help developers onboard quickly by outlining **common patterns**.
3. Clarify the **roles of different configurations** (root, environment-specific, package-specific).
4. Ensure **all configurations are well-understood** to reduce misconfigurations or redundancy.

---

### 2. Documentation Scope

The documentation will include but is not limited to:
1. **Root Configurations:** The purpose and structure of the `tsconfig.json`.
2. **Environment-Specific Configurations:** How the Node and Web configurations extend the root and their unique requirements.
3. **Package-Level Overrides:** How each package customizes configurations.
4. **Configuration Relationships:** How root, environment-specific, and localized configurations are layered together.

---

### 3. Configuration Overview for Documentation

TypeScript configurations follow a **hierarchical pattern**, so documentation should reflect that with a **sectional breakdown**, as shown below:

#### 3.1 Root Configuration (`tsconfig.json`)

The **root configuration** covers shared behaviors used universally across the project. It's essential to provide a detailed breakdown of the key options here, with explanations of why they're included.

**Key Details to Document:**
- General flags like `target` and `module`.
- Shared settings such as `strict`, `sourceMap`, and `declaration`.
- Include/exclude paths (e.g., `packages/**/*`).

Example:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "CommonJS",
    "lib": ["ES2022"],
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "declaration": true
  },
  "include": ["packages/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist", "**/*.test.ts"]
}
```

Key Points for Documentation:
- Clear definition of `compilerOptions` and how they standardize behavior across **Node.js** and **browser** builds.
- Explanation for include/exclude to prevent compilation of unnecessary files.

---

#### 3.2. Environment-Specific Configurations

Each **environment** (Node.js and Browser) introduces distinct requirements, like module systems and type-safety rules. The documentation should highlight:
- Why environment-specific configurations exist.
- The enhancements they provide over the root configuration.

**Node.js Example Configuration:** `tsconfig.node.json`
```json
{
  "extends": "./tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "CommonJS",
    "lib": ["ES2022"],
    "types": ["node"],
    "outDir": "dist/node"
  },
  "include": ["server/**/*", "shared/**/*"]
}
```

**Key Documentation Points:**
- Why `CommonJS` is used for module compatibility.
- Inclusion of `node` typings (`types` property) for back-end development.

---

**Browser Example Configuration:** `tsconfig.web.json`
```json
{
  "extends": "./tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "ESNext",
    "lib": ["DOM", "ES2022"],
    "types": ["browser"],
    "outDir": "dist/web"
  },
  "include": ["client/**/*", "shared/**/*"]
}
```

**Key Documentation Points:**
- Explanation of `ESNext` for module syntax in modern browsers.
- Inclusion of `DOM` library for browser compatibility.
- Focus on client-side use cases (e.g., with tools like Vite or Webpack).

---

#### 3.3. Package-Level Overrides

Package-level configurations adjust **environment-specific configs** to meet individual package needs. Documenting this ensures developers understand the **scope** of these files.

Example: `packages/server/tsconfig.json`
```json
{
  "extends": "../../tsconfig.node.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "../../dist/server"
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

**Document These Points:**
- How the `extends` property allows packages to inherit environment-specific configurations.
- Adjustments for output paths (`outDir`) for specific package builds.
- How `include` and `exclude` manage the files that TypeScript analyzes at a package level.

---

#### 3.4. Configuration Relationships

This section should visually document how configurations are related:
- **Root Configurations (`tsconfig.json`)** form the base.
- **Environment-Specific Configurations** extend and specialize for either Node or Browser.
- **Package Configurations** fine-tune settings inherited from environment-specific configurations.

It helps to use charts or hierarchy diagrams that visually demonstrate the relationships among configurations.

---

### 4. Documenting Using TypeDoc

TypeDoc ties everything together by creating a structured **configuration documentation** from comments or annotations within the codebase itself. Each configuration—root, environment-specific, or local package—can be annotated to ensure accurate descriptions.

You might organize the generated documentation into:
1. **Modules:** Which files/parts of the configuration belong to Node.js or the browser.
2. **Properties:** An explanation of key options like `target`, `module`, or `outDir`.
3. **Relationships:** How configurations are layered for consistency and flexibility.

Documentation can also include built-in models for future use when introducing more packages or environments.

---

## Roadmap Section: Automation

While documentation provides the knowledge framework around configurations, the roadmap focuses on how **automation** can streamline repetitive tasks such as setting up new packages or managing configurations.

### Automation Goals

- Reduce manual overhead when creating new packages.
- Maintain **consistent structure and behavior** across existing and future packages.

---

### Automation Strategy

#### 1. Template Folder

The `template` folder provides a starting point to simplify how new packages are created:
- `src/index.ts`: Your new package's entry point.
- `tsconfig.json`: Extends the root or appropriate environment-specific configuration.
- `package.json`: Contains default metadata and dependency stubs.

---

#### 2. Automated Workflow for Package Creation

To simplify adding new packages, a small workflow can automate copying templates and setting up configuration files.

Example Process:
1. Copy the `template` folder into the `packages` directory under a new folder.
2. Update the `tsconfig.json` to extend the appropriate environment configuration (e.g., `tsconfig.node.json` for server packages).
3. Adjust metadata (e.g., name, version, dependencies) in `package.json`.

---

### Future Roadmap

Moving forward, automation can be extended to:
- Dynamically update include paths in root `tsconfig.json` files when new packages are added.
- Introduce linting or validation tools to ensure configuration consistency across packages.

By separating this automation into a dedicated roadmap, it becomes clear how implementation of these tools can complement and enhance the overall project workflow.

---

## Summary

By separating documentation and automation concerns, this structure achieves:
- A clean, modular documentation approach using **TypeDoc** to describe roots, environments, and packages hierarchically.
- Plans for future scalability by automating package management in a **roadmap** structure tailored for team growth and larger projects.
