# **Configuration Guide for DiAICodeAssistant Repository**

This guide outlines the configuration management strategy for the entire repository. It ensures developers can configure
their environments effectively while keeping the repository clean, consistent, and version-control safe.

---

## **Configuration Management Principles**

1. **Templated Initialization**:
    - Configuration begins with **template files** that define default values for various environments (e.g.,
      development, staging, production).
    - Developers initialize their environment by generating **transient config files** from these templates.

2. **Transient Config Files**:
    - Environment-specific configuration files are stored **locally** and excluded from version control via
      `.gitignore`.
    - These files allow customization without introducing noise or dependencies into the repository.

3. **Global Configuration**:
    - Team-wide settings (e.g., feature flags, logging levels) are stored in version-controlled files and shared across
      the project.
    - Global configurations prioritize consistency over flexibility.

4. **Isolation and Recovery**:
    - Developers can reset their configuration to a **clean state** at any point by regenerating transient files from
      templates.
    - This ensures errors or conflicts are resolved effortlessly without affecting shared configurations.

---

## **Repository Configuration Structure**

The repository is structured as follows to implement these principles:

```plaintext
/config/
├── templates/                 # Templated configurations (version-controlled)
│   ├── development-template.json
│   ├── staging-template.json
│   ├── production-template.json
├── local/                     # Transient configurations (generated, .gitignored)
│   ├── development.json
│   ├── staging.json
├── global-config.json         # Shared configuration (version-controlled)
└── README.md                  # Documentation for configuration
```

### **Explanation of Directories and Files**

1. **`/templates/`**
    - Contains **template configuration files** that define the baseline for each environment.
    - Templates are included in version control to ensure consistency for all contributors.

   Example:
   ```json
   {
     "apiEndpoint": "https://default-api.example.com",
     "debug": false,
     "loggingLevel": "info"
   }
   ```

2. **`/local/`**
    - Contains **transient config files** generated during initialization.
    - These are user-specific and must not be committed to version control.
    - `.gitignore` ensures these files are excluded:
      ```plaintext
      /config/local/
      ```

3. **`global-config.json`**
    - Stores **team-wide settings** (e.g., feature flags, global endpoints).
    - Changes to this file must be agreed upon by the team to ensure they apply universally.

4. **`README.md`**
    - This documentation file provides guidance on managing repository configurations.

## **Workflow for Managing Configurations**

The following steps outline how to work with the repository's configuration system:

### **1. Initialization**

Developers initialize their environment using the `init` command, which:

- Prompts for environment-specific inputs.
- Copies a template configuration to the `/config/local/` directory.
- Customizes the transient file based on user inputs.

Example:

```bash
./DiAICodeAssistant init
✔ Environment: development
✔ API endpoint: https://localhost:4000
✔ Debug mode: true
✔ Generating development.json in /config/local/...
Initialization complete!
```

**Result**: A transient configuration file like `config/local/development.json` is created.

---

### **2. Customization**

Developers can edit their local configuration files (e.g., `development.json`) to suit their specific workflow:

- Changes affect only their local environment.
- For example:
  ```json
  {
    "apiEndpoint": "http://localhost:4000/api",
    "debug": true,
    "loggingLevel": "debug"
  }
  ```

This file remains private to the developer’s machine and will not impact the repository or other team members.

---

### **3. Global Configuration Updates**

Team-wide configurations are managed in `global-config.json`:

- This file is version-controlled to ensure all contributors use consistent global settings.

For example:

```json
{
  "featureFlags": {
    "enableExperimentalFeatures": true,
    "useNewAPI": false
  },
  "defaultTimeout": 5000
}
```

Changes to `global-config.json` require a pull request and team review to avoid unintended side effects.

---

### **4. Resetting Configurations**

If an environment becomes corrupted or stale, developers can reset their setup by:

1. Deleting the transient files in `/config/local/`.
2. Re-running the `init` command to regenerate files from templates.

Command example:

```bash
./DiAICodeAssistant reset
✔ Transient configuration files deleted.
✔ Initialized fresh configurations.
```

This workflow ensures developers always have a way to revert to a clean, consistent state.

---

## **Best Practices**

1. **Keep Transient Configurations Private**
    - Always exclude `/config/local/` from version control to avoid exposing private or environment-specific settings.

2. **Use Environment Variables for Sensitive Values**
    - Never store sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) in configuration files.
    - Use `.env` files with tools like `dotenv` to manage sensitive data securely.

3. **Version Control Templated and Global Settings**
    - Only commit files in `/config/templates/` and `global-config.json`.
    - Use pull requests to manage updates collaboratively.

4. **Role-Based Templates**
    - Consider expanding templates to support role-specific configurations (e.g., backend vs. frontend preferences).

---

## **Future Enhancements**

1. **Environment Profiles**:
    - Automate the generation of profiles for specific roles or setups (e.g., debugging, benchmarking).

2. **Dynamic Overrides**:
    - Enable runtime modifications to configurations without requiring file edits (e.g., CLI flags, runtime context).

3. **Cloud Collaboration**:
    - Synchronize shared configurations via a cloud service (e.g., Google Firebase or AWS AppConfig) for distributed
      teams.

4. **Visualization Tools**:
    - Build a GUI or web-based tool to manage templates, global settings, and overrides interactively.

This guide provides a structured, team-friendly approach to managing all configurations for the **DiAICodeAssistant**
repository. By combining transient files, templates, and global settings, the system minimizes errors, improves
consistency, and ensures scalability for future growth.
