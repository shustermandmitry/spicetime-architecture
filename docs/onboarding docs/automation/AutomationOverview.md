# **Automation Overview**

## **Purpose**

The project includes a highly automated system designed to streamline workflows, enforce coding standards, and maintain consistency across all phases of the development lifecycle. This automation covers:

- Code linting and formatting.
- Commit message validation.
- Monorepo management via **Turborepo**.
- Efficient and structured documentation generation.
- Seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines using **GitHub Actions**.

## **Key Components of Automation**

### 1. **Linting and Formatting**
- **Tools Used**:
  - **ESLint**: Validates JavaScript/TypeScript code for syntax and best practices.
  - **Prettier**: Ensures consistent code formatting.
  - **CommitLint**: Enforces standards for commit messages, helping maintain clear and structured commit history.

- **How It Works**:
  - Configured using files like `.lintstagedrc.js` and `commitlint.config.js`.
  - Linting and formatting are triggered locally during pre-commit hooks or staged files.
  - GitHub Actions automate lint checks for code and commit messages in CI pipelines.

---

### 2. **Commit Message Validation with CommitLint**
- **Purpose**:
  CommitLint ensures that all commit messages follow a unified, conventional format, which is essential for maintainability and clarity in project history.

- **Key Features**:
  - Validates commit **types** (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `docs`) according to the **Conventional Commits** specification.
  - Enforces consistent casing for scopes and subjects.
  - Limits subject and body line lengths for readability.

- **How It Works**:
  - CommitLint runs during the **Git commit phase**.
  - If a commit message doesn't follow the rules, the commit is rejected.
  - Configured in `commitlint.config.js` for custom rules and conventions.

---

### 3. **Documentation Generation**
- **Typedoc**:
  - Creates structured codebase documentation.
  
- **C4Builder**:
  - Automates generating architecture diagrams.

These tools integrate documentation generation seamlessly with overall workflows.

---

### 4. **GitHub Integration**
- Automatically lints, formats, and validates commits via **GitHub Actions** workflows.
- Validates commit messages using CommitLint in CI pipelines, ensuring the project's commit history remains clean.

Example CommitLint CI Workflow:
```yaml
jobs:
  lint-commits:
    name: Validate Commit Messages
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install CommitLint
        run: pnpm install @commitlint/{cli,config-conventional}

      - name: Run CommitLint
        run: |
          head -n 1 <<< $(git log -1 --pretty=%B) | npx commitlint
```

---

### 5. **Turborepo: Role in Monorepo Management**
Turborepo ensures efficient build and task management across the monorepo. Tasks like linting (`lint`), testing (`test:ci`), documentation generation (`docs`), and commit validation are orchestrated through Turborepoâ€™s caching and dependency graph.

Key Features:
- Parallel task execution.
- Dependency-aware caching.
- Efficient package management.

---

### **Workflow Overview**

1. **Pre-Commit Stage**:
   - Code is linted and formatted using tools like ESLint and Prettier.
   - Commit messages are validated with CommitLint to ensure compliance.

2. **Push and PR Stage (GitHub Actions)**:
   - CI triggers actions to validate code changes, commit messages, and documentation updates across affected packages.

3. **Turborepo Management**:
   - Tasks like linting, testing, and documentation are optimized for speed and accuracy.

---

## **Benefits of Automation**

1. **Consistency**:
   - Commit and code quality are enforced seamlessly throughout development.
   
2. **Efficiency**:
   - Processes are tailored to affect only the parts of the codebase that require updates.
   
3. **Reliability**:
   - Every commit and push is validated for correctness before merging or deployment.

4. **Scalability**:
   - CommitLint, along with Turborepo and GitHub Actions, adapts to the growing needs of the project.

---

### **Future Improvements**

- Expand commit message validations to include custom scopes for different features.
- Combine commit linting with automated changelog generation for releases.
- Tighten integration with PR templates for enhanced code reviews.

Commit linting specifically ensures a structured commit history that both humans and tooling (e.g., changelog generators) can understand.
