# Using WebStorm's Git Plugin with Accountability: Meaningful and Timely Commits

Managing your commits responsibly ensures the project remains clean, navigable, and collaborative. **Great commit practices align with accountability goals**, emphasizing structured and logical commit histories that tell the project's story—without turning it into an unreadable diary.

Here’s what this means in practice:

---

## **Accountability Goals**

Your goal as a team member is to maintain a **clear, well-structured Git history** that reflects the logical progression of meaningful changes without spamming irrelevant, disjointed, or excessive commits.

### **Golden Rules of Commit Accountability**

1. **Maintain Time Granularity**:  
   Don’t procrastinate. If you’ve reached a meaningful checkpoint in your work, **commit immediately in a contextually relevant way**. Waiting until you accumulate a mountain of half-forgotten, contradicting changes:
    - Obliterates the **temporal structure** of your work.
    - Forces you to reconstruct a timeline you likely no longer remember.
    - Creates confusion and frustration for others navigating Git history.

2. **Avoid "Too Bad" Commits**:  
   A single, haphazard commit like this only undermines the project:This is the fastest way to clutter the Git history with meaningless noise. It provides no insight into **why** the change was made or **what problem it solved**, leaving collaboration and debugging efforts dead in the water. Don't be *that* contributor.

3. **Separate Trial-and-Error from Meaningful Changes**:  
   Your **drafts, meanderings, and goofy blunders** belong with you. The main Git history is for polished, logical, and actionable commits that add value.
    - Finish your sequence of experimentation or trial-and-error work *locally*.
    - Once you're confident in a **lasting and meaningful state**, make a well-documented commit.
    - If you want to keep granular checkpoints from experiments, stash them:
      ```bash
      git stash
      ```

4. **Don’t Spam Commits**:  
   A commit should represent an **intentional, focused change**—not a smattering of thoughts or incremental saves. Avoid flooding the history with minor changes that could have been bundled into a single coherent commit.

### An Anti-Pattern to Avoid:
Example of spammy commit behavior:Instead, use **batches of granular but semantic commits**, like:---


Combining accountability goals with WebStorm’s Git tooling ensures you:
- **Don’t lose changes to procrastination.**
- **Craft logical commits that tell a meaningful story.**
- **Avoid spamming commits that add no value.**

### **1. Strike When the Iron is Hot**
As soon as you’ve reached a **logical checkpoint**:
1. Review the changes locally using WebStorm’s "Local Changes" tab (`Cmd+9` or `Ctrl+9`).
2. Use WebStorm’s **visual diff viewer** to isolate relevant changes and discard noise (e.g., experimental code or commented-out blocks).
3. Stage your relevant changes by selecting:
    - Specific lines in a file, or
    - Entire files that belong to the same semantic scope.

### **2. Commit Granularity Guidelines**
When building a commit:
1. **Focus on Atomicity**:  
   A commit should represent a single coherent change:
    - BAD: Mixing a bug fix and new feature.
    - GOOD: Isolating the bug fix so it’s easy to track and debug later.

2. **Balance Granularity and Grouping**:
    - Avoid **oversplitting** changes; include related logic in one commit.
    - Avoid **overbunching** unrelated changes; reviewers shouldn’t need to untangle unrelated modifications.

   Examples:
    - **Too granular**:  
      `fix(color): header color tweak`  
      `fix(color): footer color tweak`
    - **Better**:  
      `fix(styles): standardize header and footer colors`

### **3. Commit Immediately After Completion**
Once you've completed a meaningful change:
1. **Stage It**:
    - Go to `Local Changes` > Select a file > View diffs for specific lines.
2. **Write a Semantic Commit**:
    - Use a clear description:
      ```bash
      feat(navbar): improve responsiveness on mobile devices
      ```
    - Avoid vague entries:
      ```bash
      "fixes" or "stuff"
      ```

3. **Don’t Overthink Small Modifications**:
   Small fixes (e.g., typo corrections, doc updates) can be grouped logically:
   ```bash
   fix(docs): correct spelling in README
   ```

## **Use the Git Commit Message to Communicate**

A Git commit is **not your diary**—it is a **communication tool**:
- Tell others (and your future self!) **what** the change does and **why** it’s important.
- Always include a clear, concise subject line:---

## **Use the Git Commit Message to Communicate**

A Git commit is **not your diary**—it is a **communication tool**:
- Tell others (and your future self!) **what** the change does and **why** it’s important.
- Always include a clear, concise subject line:- If needed, add detailed context in the body:Clear commit messages reflect accountability and respect for your collaborators.

## **Managing Local Changes to Avoid Procrastination**

If you’re juggling unfinished tasks and feel overwhelmed:
1. **Shelve/Unstage Changes**:
    - Shelve unrelated work for later.
      ```bash
      git stash
      ```
3. **Break Up in WebStorm**:
    - In "Local Changes," visually divide chunks into **separate contexts**.
    - Stage and commit each context sequentially.

4. **Be Disciplined**:
   Don’t let local changes snowball into 15 files and contradictory modifications. Commit regularly and clearly—we don’t want to reverse-engineer your thought process.

## **Accountability Mindset: Be Your Team’s Ally**

- **Don’t make the project about you**: We aren’t interested in the complete saga of your work session—our Git history isn’t your life story.
- **Respect the history**: Your team depends on it to debug, review, and learn from past decisions.
- **Communicate effectively**: Commit thoughtfully and responsibly.

### In Summary:
1. **Commit logically and frequently.**
2. **Complete an effort before committing.**
3. **Separate experiments and polished work.**
4. **Structure commits so they are easy for others to read, review, and navigate.**
5. **Avoid spam or procrastination-induced chaos.**

## **Always Eat Your Own Dogfood**

The Git history you produce is not just for others—it’s a mirror reflecting the integrity and coherence of your work. Every so often:

1. **Revisit Your Own Git History**  
   Go back a few months and read your commit history. Now, put yourself in a collaborator's shoes:
   - Can you understand why and how certain changes were made?
   - Does it tell a logical, constructive story?
   - Would you appreciate working with this kind of commit history?

   Be honest with yourself, but **don’t call yourself bad names**! Instead of self-criticism, take it as an opportunity to *learn and improve*. Every reflection is progress.

2. **Eat the Dogfood Others Cooked**  
   Review the commit history crafted by your teammates. When you find areas for improvement:
   - Be constructive. Avoid upsetting or insulting others, but **provide actionable insights**.
   - Mentor where possible—help them hone their skills and create better habits.

### **Remember the Karma**

Thats the name of our coin, and the amount of your Karma is tied to your ethical score

Yes, you will be judged in a very precize manner by a very precize device, AI agent we are developing
And the quality of that agent is up to the quality of your conduct, and that determines how much our coin will be valued on open market.

But thats subject of another doc, how our DAO operates
