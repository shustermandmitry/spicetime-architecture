# **This is a DAO, You Will Get Paid**

Welcome to the DAO. Let’s break this down clearly, because this isn’t just another workplace—this is a system shaped by both your input and the metrics we all agree to. Here, everything you do has weight. Think of your contributions as throwing objects into gravity—it either builds momentum or creates drag.

### **Gravity: A Guiding Principle**
Gravity in this context is the force that organizes work. It represents the pull exerted by your actions—positive or negative. A well-maintained trajectory solidifies your standing in the system; unnecessary friction counters your momentum.

This isn’t arbitrary. The DAO operates on transparent scoring and metrics that align individual effort with collective needs. Gravity ensures that what you do is reflected fairly, and that the system rewards and adjusts accordingly.

### **How It Works**
1. **Scoring:** Every interaction has a ripple effect. Clean, clear commits, well-defined tasks, and thoughtful collaboration increase your weight positively. Conversely, actions that complicate processes or add friction introduce counterforces that reduce your impact.
2. **Metrics:** Objective measurements—commit quality, task execution, and communication clarity—drive the system. Subjective inputs, like team feedback and the ability to work collaboratively, also factor in. Together, these elements ensure that the score is balanced and reflective of reality.
3. **Gravity in Practice:** Over time, your contributions shape your trajectory. A balanced approach builds trust and efficiency, focusing gravity in your favor. Misalignment creates resistance, hampering progress for everyone, including yourself. It’s not personal—it’s a framework built to stay aligned with the goals of the DAO.

### **How Payment is Tied to the System**
You’ll be paid based on the gravity you generate. Every meaningful contribution moves you forward, ensuring that payment isn’t just tied to output but to impact. This doesn’t mean perfection—it means deliberate, conscious effort. Maintaining steady forward momentum is what keeps everything functional.

This is the framework designed to align the DAO with its contributors, avoiding chaos while rewarding meaningful progress. Respect the system, and it’ll respect you.
