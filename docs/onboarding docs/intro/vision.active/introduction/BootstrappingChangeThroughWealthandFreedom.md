# Bootstrapping Change Through Wealth and Freedom

The core idea is to use money as the gravitational field for transformation. Wealth becomes the force that drives adoption, scales innovation, and creates momentum. Instead of disrupting existing systems through revolution, we foster a self-inflating process where good ideas multiply through aligned incentives.

## Key Points
- **Money Talks:** Wealth is the core motivator for social adoption. By aligning wealth generation with freedom infrastructure, we provide a practical alternative to fractious systems.
- **Freedom Infrastructure:** Create enterprises built on scalable and distributed systems, empowering individuals as they grow the network itself.
- **Patchwork Commerce:** Solve existing inefficiencies by designing solutions that monetize while distributing benefit, creating a win-win-win dynamic for creators, communities, and the infrastructure.
