# Modular Smart Contracts: The Backbone of Trust and Automation

Smart contracts serve as the foundation for trust and functionality in the idea marketplace, ensuring all processes, from collaboration to wealth distribution, are automated, transparent, and enforceable.

## Key Features of Modular Smart Contracts
1. **Transparency:**
   - Every transaction, revenue share, or action is publicly verifiable on a blockchain.
   - Eliminates the need for intermediaries.

2. **Automation:**
   - Contracts self-execute when predefined conditions are met, reducing manual intervention.
   - E.g., royalties are automatically distributed to contributors based on usage or revenue generation.

3. **Customizability:**
   - Modular design allows contracts to be tailored for specific use cases while adhering to common standards.
   - Examples include splitting earnings, licensing content, or governing voting within collaborations.

## Core Modules of Smart Contracts
### 1. **Royalty Distribution Module**
- Handles equitable revenue sharing for creators, collaborators, and the infrastructure fund.
- Supports dynamic computation:
  - Contributors receive compensation proportional to their effort or impact.
  - Infrastructure receives a fixed percentage for reinvestment into the ecosystem.

### 2. **Collaboration Governance Module**
- Defines ownership distribution among collaborators.
- Allows dynamic adjustments when new contributors join or evolve the project.
- Facilitates community-driven governance through tokenized voting mechanisms.

### 3. **Licensing and Usage Module**
- Protects intellectual property within the open marketplace.
- Defines rules for reusing patches or integrating solutions into new projects.
- Automates royalty calculations for usage of pre-existing code or ideas.

### 4. **Milestone Tracking Module**
- Ensures incremental funding release based on project milestones.
- Encourages accountability for contributors and creates clear development timelines.
- Integrates seamlessly with the diAI to track project progress automatically.

## Example Workflow with Smart Contracts
1. **Submit an Idea:**
   - A creator submits their idea to the marketplace.
   - The diAI defines the necessary actions to refine and commercialize it.

2. **Generate a Revenue-Sharing Contract:**
   - A smart contract is created to govern revenue distribution:
     - 50% to the original creator.
     - 20% to collaborators (if applicable).
     - 30% to the infrastructure pool.

3. **Trigger Execution on Sale:**
   - When a product is sold, funds are distributed instantly and automatically:
     - Royalties are sent to respective wallets.
     - Community infrastructure is funded for reinvestment.

## Technical Stack
### 1. **Languages:**
   - Solidity (Ethereum) or alternatives like Rust (Solana) are used to implement contracts.
   - Modular templates can be pre-built to ensure rapid on-boarding.

### 2. **Blockchain Network:**
   - Ethereum or Solana for main functionality.
   - Polygon (Layer 2) or similar solutions for scalability and low transaction costs.

### 3. **Standardization:**
   - Compliance with existing standards: ERC-20 for tokens, ERC-721 for NFTs, ERC-1155 for multi-token contracts.
   - Enables compatibility across various blockchain ecosystems.

## Benefits of Modular Contracts
- **Efficiency:** Eliminates manual administrative bottlenecks.
- **Fairness:** Contributors are compensated based on verifiable contributions.
- **Scalability:** Framework supports rapid expansion of the ecosystem with minimal friction.
- **Trust:** Transparency ensures all parties know where funds flow and how decisions are governed.
