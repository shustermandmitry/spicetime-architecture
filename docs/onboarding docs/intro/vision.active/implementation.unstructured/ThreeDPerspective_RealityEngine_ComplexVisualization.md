## 2. Reality Engine: Core Physics & Simulation Engine

The **Reality Engine** forms the heart of the visualization system. It accurately simulates physical laws and generates a dynamic environment in real time.

### Features:
- **Gravity Simulation:**
  - AI-assisted modeling of gravitational forces, task/body trajectories, and system balancing.
- **Dynamic Objects:**
  - Simulate real-time interaction between virtual objects based on size, position, and mass.
- **Physics Models:**
  - Supports **Newtonian Physics**, **General Relativity-inspired Gravity Wells**, or custom simulation models.

### Core Workflow:
**Physics Simulation âž¡ Data Transformation âž¡ Streamed VR/3D Outputs**

1. **Define Initial State:** Initialize objects, their attributes (mass, position, velocity), and gravity conditions.
2. **Simulate Dynamics:** Apply physics rules to evolve interactions between objects.
3. **Output Transformation:** Convert simulation states into VR/3D-compatible formats via a real-time service.
4. **Stream Results:** Provide outputs to VR and Web visualizations dynamically.

#### Example Reality Engine Stub:
```javascript
class RealityEngine {
    constructor(config) {
        this.gravity = config.gravity; // e.g., { strength: 9.8, type: "Newtonian" }
        this.objects = config.objects; // Array of objects with mass & position
    }

    simulate() {
        this.objects.forEach(obj => {
            obj.velocity.y -= this.gravity.strength * 0.1; // Apply gravity
            obj.position.y += obj.velocity.y; // Update position
        });
        return this.objects;
    }
}

// Usage example
const realityEngine = new RealityEngine({
    gravity: { strength: 9.8 },
    objects: [{ mass: 50, position: { x: 0, y: 10, z: 0 }, velocity: { y: 0 } }]
});

const simulationResults = realityEngine.simulate();
```

## 3. Real-Time Transformation and Streaming Service

The **Transformation Service** is responsible for turning the outputs of the Reality Engine into **VR-ready** or **browser-compatible** visualizations.

### Features:
- **Data Normalization:**
  - Converts raw simulation outputs into formats suitable for 3D rendering frameworks like Three.js or WebXR.
- **Real-Time Output Rendering:**
  - Streams updated simulation states to the embedded VR or WebSite component every frame/tick.

#### Example Chain:
1. **Reality Engine Outputs:** 
    `{ position: { x, y, z }, velocity, mass }`
2. **Transform Service Normalizes:**
    - Converts to vertex/mesh data for VR/Web renderings.
3. **Stream to UI Components:** 
    - Updates visualizations dynamically.

## 4. VR Child Component: Immersive 3D Display

Provides **real-time, physics-driven VR environments** for an unparalleled immersive experience.

### Features:
- **Real-Time Updates:** Displays Reality Engine dynamics in virtual space instantly.

```jsx
<VR library="WebXR">
    <Scene source="RealTimePhysicsData">
        <Object type="TaskNode" position={{ x: 1, y: 5, z: 2 }} />
        <GravityField center={{ x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 }} strength="9.8" />
    </Scene>
</VR>
