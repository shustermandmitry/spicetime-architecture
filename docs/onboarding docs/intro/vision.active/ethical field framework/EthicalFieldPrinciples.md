# Ethical Field Principles

## Summary
This document outlines the core **principles driving the Ethical Field Framework**. It explores how ethical alignment, field distortions, and redistribution balance resource flows within complex systems.

## Key Principles
1. **Ethical Alignment**: Every entity (a node) has an ethical score, representing its alignment with community goals.
2. **Field Dynamics**: Misaligned behaviors create distortions in the field, influencing the flow of resources and opportunities.
3. **Mass Formation**: Certain nodes act as attractors or vortices (positive or negative) for wealth and resources based on their alignment score.
4. **Redistribution**: As a field correction tool, redistribution dynamically adjusts resource flows for balance.
5. **Center of Gravity**: The "ethical center" represents an ideal alignment but is dynamic, influenced by external forces and larger interconnected systems.

## Goals
- To use **practical tools like graph databases** to model ethical fields.
- To incentivize ethical behaviors through **weighted interactions and policy mechanisms like taxation**.
- To ensure equitable resource flows within complex networks.
