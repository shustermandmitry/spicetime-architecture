# Ethical Field Dynamics

This document explains how ethical fields form, distort, and shape the flow of resources, using analogies to gravitational fields.

## Core Dynamics
- **Nodes and Connections**: Defining nodes (people, orgs, houses, etc.) and edges (relationships, transactions).
- **Field Potential**: Ethical scores create local potentials, influencing surrounding nodes.
- **Distortions**: Misaligned nodes warp resource flows, creating localized crises or concentrations.

## Visual Representation
- Diagrams showing **curved space** and resource flows around aligned vs. misaligned nodes.
