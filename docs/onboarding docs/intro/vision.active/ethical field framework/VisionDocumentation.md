- **methodology/**: Step-by-step technical details, including graph database structures, ethical score computation, and redistribution mechanisms.
- **use_cases/**: Practical examples to demonstrate application in various industries (e.g., resource allocation, taxation, prediction modeling).
- **limitations_and_risks.md**: Known challenges and precautions for using the framework.
- **future_directions.md**: Proposed enhancements and areas of research.
- **glossary.md**: Definition of terms for clarity and consistency.
