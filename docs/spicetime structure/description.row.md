## NOTE: we will be on the level of high abstractions

* Theres a notion of global and universal spacetime

Its same for everyone, as far as space
However, time is local
This global universal space does not exist anywhere, not as a single entity, stored in some database

* its sharded between nodes of space.

Think of human heads, or private perspectives.
we have a common notion of objects in space and their position.
We can agree on locations of nodes.

* notion of history of each object is in each head

we all have our own memory, thats where histories live.
thats where time is rooted
So, each perspective maintains its own view of history, for each node in its view,
progression of objects in temporal dimension.

* Spicetime will model this

rather create an implementation mimicking this structure.

* personal perspective

for each human, or an org, there will be a personal private network, space of personal perspective.

* physical layer of personal perspective

Physically, its a person or organization internal network of devices, phones and desktops and
laptops and servers, connected into intranet with minimal latency, and running a sharded AI model that deep learns on
all local content and context,
as it develops in all kind of possible and relevant ways, again depending on local context

* deep vs federated learning on personal perspective

These local AI models are connected into a global net with federated learning,
sharing updates and summaries and cooperating closer on some regional level, in some regions.
its a structure, a fractal structure, and the borders between local and regional
and global nets are blured and extandable, and so is the learning algorithms.

* what is global space

all nodes and their perspectives are united by common space.
Perspectives overlap and are kept in sync, so each observer agrees on what nodes are and their location and visible
structure.
And what creates that common space are the links and flux of information that is required to keep those perspectives in
sync
This is the ties and the energy that binds space together. and

* how personal perspective is created
  its done thru introspection and the discovery mechanism.

This is what creates that space, the links that keep perspectives in sync
to the smallest grain of that structure, the single possible imbedding, a syllable, a sound.
This is a structure that physically exists in storage, but not neceserally in its entiety, as the internal structure of
nodes is resolved lazely, as needed by users.
This structure is distributed and maintained by TeeRPC, which syncs the nodes in each computer and phone, in every
private local perspective.

Im calling those private networks perspectives, cos they maintain their own perspective on global space structure, from
their point of view within that structure, for they are part of that structure.

So, thats what the global space is, its whatever each perspective chooses to maintain. The perspectives overlap. TreeRPC
keeps them in sync. Each person can mutate structure of his perspective of
global space as long as permitted

from now on ill take a less structured approach and let claude structure it. Just to save time and and untie me from
burden of structure.
ill be at least partially using iml markdown format as per context in this project.

but how that whole universe tics into action and fullfils its purpose, tho not a strictly unified purpose of a lockstep
cohesion without any personal deviations, of a military march precision.
No, each perspective has its own agency and goal and intellegence to pursue its goal, but it does exist the bigger
object of perspective, eg an individual in community, or an org in a country.
and yes, thats what objects are. they are demarketed by the borders of ownership, domains of permition context, in which
permitions are explicitly set by the owner. once authenticated by some external means,
he is free to set permitions on access to his structure, node by node, and is able to control perception of him by
others, thru presenting a declared api, a gql api surface in the form of schema

And how these schemas are created.
They are composed out of the structure of evolving personal perspective, When personal perspective is composed out of
components, building personal spicetimeReactAPP. EACH COMPONENT PROVIDES ITS OWN schema of a public interface. these
schemas are stiched together into the fabric of publi image of the perspective. This is what other objects will be able
to discover, and no more.
But its not just a pile of component schemas in a long timeline of as components been added into jsx structure.
these schemas are restructured and resulting public schema is a distillation of some kind, and how its done is not
exactly clear,
but prbly thru interactions with personal agent, the ai that curates that perspective.

and the components might not always have a gql interface, for its just a layer on top of the TreeRPC state tree inside
of them, with a complete set of resolvers distilled for each possible path withinn that structure
as composition of path resolvers.
Thats how TreeRPC is organically grown, and its api is organically composed without any need of ai services
TreeRPC state is a complete description of space. It containes the permition structure including ownership of nodes of
space, thus demarketing objects/perspectives borders.
however, gql can still be layered on top of that, to present a commonly accepted format of API for those that are not
speaking spicetime.
and that gql schema, surface can prbly be automated, and created as a distillation of TreeRPC api shaped by permition
structure, a cross product of permissions and TreeRPC api,
prbly just a linear matrix operation, but its exact structure is not yet developed.
