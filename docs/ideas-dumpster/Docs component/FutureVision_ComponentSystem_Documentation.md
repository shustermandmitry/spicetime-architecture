## Future Vision: Modular Documentation Component System

The ultimate goal for this project is to transition to a **component-based documentation system**. Hereâ€™s the envisioned plan:

### 1. **Central `Docs` Component**
- A high-level **`Docs`** component will act as the entry point for the documentation system.
- It will manage **orchestration**, **presentation**, and **interaction** for all documentation types within the system.

### 2. **Child Components for Each Doc Type**
The `Docs` component will have **children** for each specific type of documentation, such as:

- **`GatsbyDocs`**
- **`GraphQLDocs`**
- **`TypeDocDocs`**

Each child will handle specific documentation generation/gathering tasks related to its purpose. For example:
- `GatsbyDocs` will manage Gatsby documentation content.
- `GraphQLDocs` will create or aggregate GraphQL documentation.
- `TypeDocDocs` will focus on aggregating and linking TypeScript-generated docs.

### 3. **Lower-Level Components for Structural Representation**
Each documentation type component (e.g., `GatsbyDocs`, `GraphQLDocs`, `TypeDocDocs`) will use **lower-level structural components** to work with the documentation assets:

- **`Folder`**: Represents a folder in the documentation file tree.
- **`File`**: Represents a specific documentation file inside a folder.
- **`Package`**: Represents a software package or entity in the project.
- **`ComponentPackage`**: Represents a UI or functional component package to be documented.

These components will facilitate structured generation, aggregation, and management of documentation assets internally.

### 4. **Presentation through Gatsby Pages**
After the generation and aggregation, the `Docs` system will **present** the content as part of **Gatsby pages**. While routes and structure for Gatsby pages are handled internally by Gatsby, this system will focus on **providing the correct inputs** for the Gatsby routing and content engine.

### 5. **Streamlined Modular System**
The goal is to allow the documentation system to grow modularly, where each part (e.g., GraphQL docs, TypeScript docs, Gatsby docs) remains loosely coupled but follows a cohesive parent-child data flow. This ensures:

- **Scalability**: Adding new documentation types (e.g., Swagger Docs) becomes simple.
- **Maintainability**: Each part is independently testable.
- **Consistency**: All types of documentation follow shared conventions for structure and styling.

### 6. **Tasks to Achieve This Vision**
Hereâ€™s how you can incrementally implement the system:

#### a. **Build the Component System**
- Create a `Docs` component and related child components (`GatsbyDocs`, `GraphQLDocs`, `TypeDocDocs`).
- Create structural components (`Folder`, `File`, `Package`, `ComponentPackage`) to represent the documentation assets.

#### b. **Integrate the Components**
- Connect the child components to the `Docs` parent, ensuring proper orchestration.
- Each child should handle its specific doc generation tasks (e.g., running TypeDoc, aggregating API routes).

#### c. **Design Data Flow**
- Create a unified data flow where lower-level components like `Folder` and `File` feed data or content up to the `Docs` system, ensuring it can assemble and prepare the documentation for presentation.

#### d. **Test with Gatsby Integration**
- Validate that the final generated documentation structure integrates seamlessly with Gatsby's routing and presentation mechanisms.
