# GitHub Component Roadmap

## **Overview**
The goal is to build a **modular GitHub component** that integrates into a React app. This component will:
- Manage workflows, branch validations, and automated tasks (via GitHub Actions).
- Enable **reactive AI-powered decision-making** within workflows, allowing proactive execution (e.g., auto-merge PRs, fixing errors, initiating builds).
- Serve as a scalable and reusable module within a global app structure.

This roadmap outlines the functional design, initial implementation, and next steps for developing the component in a **reactive** React ecosystem.

## **Scope of the GitHub Component**

### **Features in Phase 1**
1. **React Integration**:
   - `GitHubProvider`: Context for all GitHub-related operations and states.
   - Components like `ValidationRegion` handle specific tasks such as branch testing or PR validation.

2. **Event-Driven AI**:
   - Use hooks (e.g., `useValidationHook`) to extend reactivity.
   - React dynamically to state/data changes (e.g., failed builds, lint issues).

3. **Proactive AI**:
   - Autonomous decision-making based on system context.
   - Examples:
     - Automatically propose fixes (PRs for broken workflows).
     - Auto-merge validated PRs into branches (like `master` or `dev`).

4. **GitHub Action Workflows Integration**:
   - Use GitHub Actions to trigger core tasks (testing, linting, builds).
   - Expose key workflows into the React context as executable hooks.

### **Phase 1 Functional Architecture**

#### React Architecture Overview
```tsx
<EarthProvider> // Global context management for the entire project
  <GitHubProvider> // Context dedicated to all GitHub-related operations
    <ValidationRegion branch="master" /> // React component handling "master" branch validation
    <ValidationRegion branch="dev" />
    <ProactiveComponent /> // AI-enabled proactive decision-making
  </GitHubProvider>
</EarthProvider>
```

#### Key Elements
1. **`GitHubProvider`**: Stores global GitHub state and actions.
2. **`ValidationRegion`**: Encapsulates specific branch or task validations (e.g., testing PRs before merge).
3. **AI Hooks**: Provide reactive and proactive feature sets (failing tests trigger fixes, etc.).
4. **ProactiveComponent**: Autonomous executor of merge/fix proposals.

---

## **Phase 1 Implementation**

### **1. `GitHubProvider`**
The `GitHubProvider` component provides global context and stores GitHub-related states (e.g., branch status, test results). Actions for workflows (tests, lint fixes, merge proposals) are also stored as hooks.

#### Implementation
```tsx
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';

const GitHubContext = createContext(null);

export const GitHubProvider: React.FC<{ children: React.ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState({
    branchStatus: {}, // Holds status of branches (e.g., "master", "dev").
    testsPassed: true, // Example reactive state to monitor tests.
  });

  const actions = {
    triggerTests: () => runPNPMCommand('test'),
    autoFix: () => console.log("AI Triggering Fix!") || runPNPMCommand('lint:fix'),
    proposeMerge: () => console.log('AI proposes merge.'),
  };

  return (
    <GitHubContext.Provider value={{ state, actions }}>
      {children}
    </GitHubContext.Provider>
  );
};

// Custom Hook
export const useGitHub = () => useContext(GitHubContext);
```

---

### **2. `ValidationRegion`**
The `ValidationRegion` component is scoped to specific branches (e.g., `master` or `dev`). It runs workflows like tests and handles failure conditions.

#### Implementation
```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { useGitHub } from './GitHubProvider';

const ValidationRegion: React.FC<{ branch: string }> = ({ branch }) => {
  const { state, actions } = useGitHub();

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (!state.testsPassed) {
      actions.autoFix(); // AI proactively attempts to resolve issues.
    }
  }, [state.testsPassed]);

  return (
    <section>
      <h2>Validation for Branch: {branch}</h2>
      <button onClick={actions.triggerTests}>Run Tests</button>
    </section>
  );
};

export default ValidationRegion;
```

---

### **3. Proactive Component**
The `ProactiveComponent` is a higher-level React component that autonomously executes GitHub actions when conditions align.

#### Implementation
```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { useGitHub } from './GitHubProvider';

const ProactiveComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const { state, actions } = useGitHub();

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (state.testsPassed && isValidForAutoMerge(state.branchStatus)) {
      actions.proposeMerge(); // AI proposes auto-merge.
    }
  }, [state.testsPassed]);

  return <div>Proactive AI Decision-Making in Action</div>;
};

export default ProactiveComponent;
```

---

### **4. GitHub Actions Workflows**
To align the GitHub component with actual system workflows, we extend GitHub Action YAML definitions.

#### Example: Safeguard Pull Requests
```yaml
name: Validate Pull Request

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master
      - dev

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          npm install -g pnpm
          pnpm install

      - name: Run Tests
        run: pnpm run test

      - name: Trigger AI Fix (if needed)
        if: failure()
        run: pnpm run lint:fix
```

## **Next Steps: Optimizing GitHub Workflows**

The next phase is to streamline these workflows, ensuring they effectively integrate with your `GitHubProvider`. Steps include:

1. **Documentation**:
   - Create a markdown-based explanation of GitHub workflows.
   - Detail best practices for integrating workflows into React apps.

2. **Streamlining Workflows**:
   - Reduce redundancy across YAML files with configurable templates.
   - Expose reusable workflow hooks to `GitHubProvider`.

3. **Advanced Proactivity**:
   - Train AI analysis for patterns (e.g., identify flaky tests, optimize runs).
   - Hook AI data analytics into `ProactiveComponent` for smarter decision-making.

## **Conclusion**

This roadmap and initial implementation establish a **GitHub Component** as part of your React app. The next step is to streamline the associated GitHub workflows and document them, ensuring seamless integration and scalability.
