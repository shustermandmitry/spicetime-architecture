# Social Chromodynamics: Modeling Community Forces

## Concept Overview
- Definition: Applying quantum chromodynamics (QCD) to social group interactions.
- Interactive properties:
  - **Attraction**: Shared interests/values in a group.
  - **Repulsion**: Conflicting or competing goals.

## Theoretical Proposals
### Group Charges
- Parameters that define group properties:
  - Cohesion/Alignment/
  - Fragmentation Index.

### Fields of Interaction
- How **charged groups** exert preferences across MyReality's plane.
  - Use-case: Encouraging cooperation or addressing friction zones.
