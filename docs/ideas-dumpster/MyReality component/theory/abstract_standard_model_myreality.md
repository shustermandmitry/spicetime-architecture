# Abstract Standard Model in MyReality

## Introduction
- Brief overview of the Standard Model in physics.
- How we abstract these ideas into the **MyReality** platform.

---

## Core Components and Mapping
### 1. Particles and Fields in Digital Reality
- **Particles**: Users, organizations, gadgets, etc.
- **Fields**: Shared economic/social/state parameters.

### 2. Forces and Interactions
- Describe "interaction fields" and their computations (analogous to fundamental forces in physics).

---

## Mathematical Representation
- Present equations or algorithms describing:
  - How "particles" interact in the MyReality simulation framework.
  - Forces or constraints operating between them.

### Example Formula:
- Placeholder for your equations (e.g., tensor representations):
