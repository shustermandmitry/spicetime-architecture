# Tackling Quantum Gravity in MyReality

## Introduction
- Overview of quantum gravity problems simplified for use in **digital interactions**.

---

## Quantum vs. Classical Framework
### 1. Why Quantum Effects Matter
- Explain emergent phenomena (e.g., entanglement analogies in social or market dynamics).

### 2. Translation for Social Models
- Connect quantum gravity to **resource flow distribution or distortions**.

---

## Computational Models for Representation
### State Representation
- Key data structures used for simulating quantum states in communities.

### Observable Effects
- Examples of cross-community **"gravitational distortions"** (e.g., wealth/resource inequality when communities polarize).

---

## Evaluation
- Benchmarks or results that demonstrate quantum gravity models improving system understanding.
