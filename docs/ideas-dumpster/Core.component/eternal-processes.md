# The Eternal Processes: Core's Never-Ending Trinity

## The Never-Ending Nature

All three core processes run forever:

```typescript
interface EternalProcess {
    // No start, no end
    while: true,

    // Just keeps going
    run(): never
}
```

## Discovery Loop

```typescript
const Discovery = Process({
    // Forever exploring
    while: true,
    loop: async () => {
        // Look around
        const found = await explore()

        // Tell perspective
        await perspective.evaluate(found)

        // Adjust based on permissions
        await permission.check(found)

        // Never stops, just keeps looking
        await tick()
    }
})
```

## Perspective Loop

```typescript
const Perspective = Process({
    // Forever focusing
    while: true,
    loop: async () => {
        // Check resources
        const pressure = await checkResources()

        // Prune if needed
        if (pressure > threshold) {
            await prune()
        }

        // Shift focus based on usage
        await adjustFocus()

        // Never stops, just keeps focusing
        await tick()
    }
})
```

## Permission Loop

```typescript
const Permission = Process({
    // Forever protecting
    while: true,
    loop: async () => {
        // Monitor boundaries
        const breaches = await checkBoundaries()

        // Adjust rules based on context
        await updateRules()

        // Enforce current policies
        await enforce()

        // Never stops, just keeps protecting
        await tick()
    }
})
```

## How They Run Together

### Parallel Operation

```typescript
const Core = Process({
    // All three forever
    processes: [
        Discovery.loop(),
        Perspective.loop(),
        Permission.loop()
    ],

    // No synchronization needed
    // Each runs at its own pace
    // Natural balance emerges
})
```

### Independent yet Connected

- Each runs on its own
- Share information through state
- Naturally coordinate
- No forced sync needed

## Process Properties

### 1. No End State

```typescript
type ProcessState = {
    // There is no "done"
    complete: never,
    // Just different states of being
    current: State
}
```

### 2. Self-Adjusting

```typescript
interface ProcessAdjustment {
    // Adapts its own rhythm
    tick: {
        frequency: number,
        backoff: () => number,
        accelerate: () => number
    }
}
```

### 3. Resource Aware

```typescript
interface ProcessResources {
    // Manages its own resources
    resources: {
        current: Usage,
        adjust(): void,
        // But never stops
        minimum: MinimalUsage
    }
}
```

## Natural Rhythms

Each process has its own natural pace:

### Discovery

- Fast when exploring new areas
- Slows in familiar territory
- Bursts when changes detected
- Never completely stops

### Perspective

- Quick during high load
- Relaxed when stable
- Reactive to pressure
- Always maintaining view

### Permission

- Constant boundary checks
- Rapid response to threats
- Regular rule updates
- Continuous protection

## Core Principles

### 1. Eternal Motion

- No start or end
- Always running
- Natural rhythms
- Self-adjusting

### 2. Independent Operation

- No central control
- Self-managing
- Natural coordination
- Emergent behavior

### 3. Resource Balance

- Self-regulating
- Minimal baseline
- Efficient scaling
- Never exhausting

## Best Practices

### 1. Design for Infinity

- No end states
- Graceful adjustment
- Resource awareness
- Natural cycles

### 2. Trust the Process

- Let them run
- Don't force sync
- Allow natural rhythms
- Trust emergence

### 3. Minimal Intervention

- Self-managing
- Self-healing
- Self-adjusting
- Just let them run
