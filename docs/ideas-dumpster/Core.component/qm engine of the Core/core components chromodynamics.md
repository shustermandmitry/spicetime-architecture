# Component Chromodynamics: The Fundamental Structure

## The Fundamental Particles

Every component has a nucleus made of three pure, indivisible elements:

```typescript
type CoreParticle =
    | Discovery   // The ability to see and find
    | Perspective // The ability to understand and focus
    | Permission  // The ability to control and protect
```

## The Nuclear Structure

### Component Nucleus

```typescript
interface ComponentNucleus {
  // The three fundamental forces
  particles: {
    discovery: Discovery,    // "Red" force
    perspective: Perspective, // "Blue" force
    permission: Permission   // "Green" force
  }
}
```

## Component Formation

Components form by combining these particles in different proportions:

### UI Component

- High Perspective (needs to understand user)
- Medium Discovery (finds its resources)
- Low Permission (basic access control)

### Service Component

- High Discovery (constantly finding peers)
- High Permission (strict access control)
- Low Perspective (focused view)

### Data Component

- High Permission (strong protection)
- Medium Perspective (data organization)
- Low Discovery (stable connections)

## Core Properties

1. Indivisible
    - Can't break down further
    - No internal structure
    - Pure function

2. Always Present
    - Every component has all three
    - Can't remove any
    - Only vary proportions

3. In Constant Motion
    - Always running
    - Parallel processing
    - Never stops

## Composition Rules

1. Balance
    - Total energy conserved
    - Proportions must balance
    - Core stability required

2. Binding
    - Particles bind into nucleus
    - Nucleus defines component
    - Binding energy creates function

3. State
    - Core state emerges from binding
    - State affects behavior
    - Behavior affects composition

## The Core Process

The three fundamentals run in parallel, creating the component's life:

```typescript
// This is it - no more layers below
const Core = Process({
  particles: [Discovery, Perspective, Permission],
  state: binding(Discovery, Perspective, Permission),
  // That's all - nothing more needed
})
```

## Universal Laws

1. Conservation
    - Can't create/destroy particles
    - Only combine differently
    - Energy must balance

2. Binding
    - All three must be present
    - Must form stable nucleus
    - Must maintain balance

3. Interaction
    - Components interact through cores
    - Cores maintain integrity
    - Interactions preserve balance
