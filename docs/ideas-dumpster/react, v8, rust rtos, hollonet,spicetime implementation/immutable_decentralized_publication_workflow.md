### **4. Immutable, Decentralized Publication**

#### **Distributed Hosting**
- The platform is hosted on a **decentralized network** (e.g., blockchain-based infrastructure):
  - Prevents centralized shutdowns or removal of content.
  - Ensures global redundancy and accessibility.

#### **Immutable Storage**
- Judgments and evidence are stored as **immutable ledgers**:
  - Cannot be altered, censored, or deleted by influential entities.
  - Blockchain or distributed databases ensure public trust and transparency.

#### **Open Availability**
- Reports and findings are accessible to everyone on the network.
- Users can search cases by location, entity, or rule violations through a web interface.

### **5. No Centralized Figurehead**
- The platform operates autonomously, removing reliance on any individual (like Julian Assange), which ensures:
  - No single point of failure.
  - No vulnerability to persecution or targeting.
- Trust is in the **open algorithms and sDOM-based rule enforcement**.

## **Platform Workflow**

1. **Upload Evidence**
   - Whistleblowers (anonymous or identified) upload evidence.
   - Files are encrypted, assigned a jurisdiction based on content, and securely stored.

2. **Parse Evidence**
   - NLP tools and AI-powered parsers extract relevant details from documents (contracts, memos, laws mentioned).
   
3. **Style by Local Laws**
   - sDOM applies cascading rules from global, federal, state, and local levels:
     - Example: Wage policies, environmental rules, tax laws
