#### **Step 3: Automate Rule Enforcement**
Introduce AI-driven **smart contracts** to self-enforce rules:
- Rules are **actively monitored** in the system.
- Out-of-compliance node gets flagged or auto-updated for enforcement.

Example:  
If a business in SF tries to set sick leave at 3 days (instead of the mandated 5 days), AI automatically:
- Corrects the rule to 5 days.
- Flags the violation for reporting/governance.

### **Phase 3: Scale Globally**

#### **Step 1: Modular Expansion**
- Add new geographical regions or systems as modular subtrees:
  - Nation -> State -> City hierarchy expands into new locales.
  - New cultural/legal styles are added as overrides to baseline rules.

#### **Step 2: Harmonize Global Standards**
- Handle **conflicting rules** across borders efficiently:
  - Define priority systems for laws.
  - Use AI suggestions for unifying overlapping policies (e.g., GDPR from the EU vs. US data laws).

## **Example Implementation**

### **1. sDOM Structure**

A Rust-like implementation of the sDOM:
```rust
struct SDOMNode {
    tag: String,                       // E.g., 'business', 'employee', 'country'
    locale: String,                    // Region, e.g., 'France'
    attributes: Vec<(String, String)>, // Rules applied
    children: Vec<Box<SDOMNode>>,      // Sub-entities
}
```

Example for a French employment law:
```rust
// French sDOM example
let employee = SDOMNode {
    tag: "employee".into(),
    locale: "France".into(),
    attributes: vec![
        ("leave_days".into(), ">=5 weeks".into()),
        ("bonus_tax_exemption".into(), "if business_size < 10".into()),
    ],
    children: vec![],
};
```

Rules can be inherited and overridden efficiently:
```rust
fn cascade_styles(node: &mut SDOMNode, parent_styles: Vec<(String, String)>) {
    // Apply parent styles where no local overrides exist
    for (key, value) in parent_styles {
        if !node.attributes.iter().any(|(k, _)| k == &key) {
            node.attributes.push((key, value));
        }
    }
    // Cascade styles to children
    for child in node.children.iter_mut() {
        cascade_styles(child, node.attributes.clone());
    }
}
```

---

### **2. Developer Interaction**
From a developer's perspective, tools built on the sDOM interact with entities agnostically.

Example: **Payroll Compliance Tool**
```javascript
import { sDOM } from "global-law-simulator";

function getEffectiveWage(locale) {
  return sDOM.query(locale).getStyle('minimum_wage');
}

console.log(getEffectiveWage("san_francisco")); // $16.50
console.log(getEffectiveWage("california"));    // $15.00
```

Complex rules are **fully abstracted** while the sDOM enforces cascading behavior.

## **Vision**

By building a perfectly functional model as the foundation, we aim for:
1. A reliable, validated representation of how systems operate today.
2. An **iterative improvement framework** that ensures seamless transitions from real-life inefficiencies to highly optimized systems.
3. Adding transparency, automation, and scalability across global systems.

This approach ensures **trust** is built incrementally while **unlocking exponential efficiencies**.
