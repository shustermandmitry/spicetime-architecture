persistency in existency

The borders are murky

just shadows
The shifters

A world of a meta
We gotta do better

Simply, in prose, if everything fluid, theres no matter, or persistent entitties, like a self, or even a particle. just
chaos, quantum buble, no space and no time, no structure

So, thats where GQL stands the guard. Its so inflexible for a reason, not by design, but by universe intent, and it did
its bidding thre the necessities of the corps to maintain their identity, but kinda be able to talk to each other.

This is universal pattern, not corps fault, but a gift, of a model of reality, to us, from grifters -> to shifters

What i mean, the borders of persistent enteties gotta be declaired and maintain and guarded, Thats what GQL is for.

Treenity is the underlying infrastructure, the layer below that, but it respects the borders of declared GQL schemas, no
tunneling below the fences, but then there are things like telepathy and phycics, and we can make their abstractions
work as well, by having some meta flowing thru the cracks in the GQL wall. Itll be impossible not to. We cant tell folks
what to do, but we can give them an easy way to do it, breaking the walls, so GQL layer itself can evolve thru
competition with shadow world

its your strings that drive time to space conversion. they carry patches that add to node timelines and generate tics
and when funcs of those tics get executed, the tic goes to space. thats the motive power, the funcs that lurk behind the
names in the string, the functional chain strings
