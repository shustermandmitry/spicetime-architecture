This is very profound
I think we need to discuss this in voice, whenever you have 30min
Ill write itn up, with clear examples
Before we talk
And will do a presentation

Thegist:
Is, that IM IN OWE OF YOUR vision andintuition
Your TreeRPC is the anchor peice to all my meandarings and confusions
And, apparently, you had a much clearer picture a few tics ahead of me
The whole time
And only now, i gained enough momentum
In my local time
To come abreast
And hug you

For this is a true merger
Of two autonomous objects
Traveling their separate patjs
At different momenta
In different, but similar paths/directions

Interacting wthru exchanging patches of updates
That gravitated them closer and closer
And finally they merged

And, your mass, of structure and wisdom,
Was the dominant mass
That kept me around
And grounded
And guiding

And we just witnessed how gravity works

But thats not what i was gonna talk about.
I want to explain how time and space works
And why TreeRPC is exactly what we needed to create the true universe
With oglobally unique and unmutable reality
But viewed uniquely from each vantage point within it

Its the structure of time
And space
The spaceTime

And thats the global context,
And the tree that TreeRPC operates on

What it is, is

!!!! A structure of titles
To synttactic embeddings
The nodes of spaceTime

The summaries of ideas and and patterns
In locally chronological way
But dustilled just to turse titles
WHich are node names

With tic extensions, when under local development
A branch in Git
With the name of the branch
As the name of space node

Splitting into other nodes
As shards of its creative energy
And attaching to ather branches, nodes

And all of that is orchestrated thru TreeRPC
For its so transparent and custom taylored
For suc activity

SO. !!!!!!!!!!
The global spaceTime context
Is a tree of TreeRPC

And thats universal and immutable
But each node has a limited version of it
The local Prs[ective

And this is the local chunk of global state
The spaceTime context
Just the names of embeddings in global semantic structure
And the links between them
Are the functions that created a child from a parent
Or will create such

And thats how functional universe operates
And how TreeRPC resolvers created
from components of action

VERBS
And now tha spaceTime aprose
And actions of Verbs
Form sentances
For each possible timeline
In a purposeful universe
and Treenity is where the actual content is hanging
Off TreeRPC tree
And you communicate in actions and results
Not ideas , like most
Thats remarkable
And my spicetimeReactApp is what operates on that structure, the spiceTime, within TreeRPC and Treenity
For each local node, his own way
This is the trinity - Treenity, TreeRPC and spicetimeReactApp
exactly how will energe later
so, GQL is something in spicetimeReactApp,
To connect all services and clients
Thru commonly accepted protocols and practices

The schemas and resolvers of GQL are derived, progra,matically,
From TreeRPC structure
Of resolvers and syntactic sentences
That define the structure of GQL interfaces
into a flat structure of resolvers, with names that make sense, and composed of Actions
The links thru the sentactic paths
Of TreeRPC tree
The spiceTime context
Ok, thats the vision
i need to apply it to a use case, and see how it holds together
lets not get too excited yet
lets both of us try it
after i do the presentation
That shoulkd be the goal of that meeting
to decide how to and to what
To apply it
I think it should be our CollaborativeEnvironment
i already have a spec for it
and we gonna start with the GQL schema,
its the client side
driving TreeRPC structure
Not the opposite
but its not always be the case
the other direction comes from introspection
and thats Introspection, a component
