# Proposed Dynamic GraphQL Inference Framework

## **Overview**

This framework automates the generation of GraphQL schemas by analyzing Treenity’s real-time patch streams. It observes
functional patch patterns, extracts meaningful activities, and dynamically generates GraphQL APIs that represent
entities, processes, and lifecycles. It also offers schema optimization by comparing inferred structures to known
successful patterns.

## **Goals**

1. **Dynamic Schema Creation**:
    - Observe real-time patches and their lifecycles.
    - Infer entities, operations, and relationships to generate GraphQL schemas.
2. **Schema Restructuring**:
    - Suggest schema optimizations based on emerging or repeated patch patterns.
    - Align services with known, marketable GraphQL patterns.
3. **Automation**:
    - Reduce manual effort required for schema design.
    - Create marketable services dynamically from live activities.

## **Key Workflow**

### **Step 1: Observing Functional Patch Patterns**

The first step involves monitoring Treenity’s functional patch activity. Each patch carries:

- **Tree Path**: Where the activity is happening in the tree.
- **Operation**: Action type like `ADD`, `EDIT`, `DELETE`, `EXECUTE`.
- **Value/Metadata**: Data attached to the patch (e.g., properties, types, or relationships).
- **Functional Chains**: Sequences of operations representing an intent (e.g., `assign -> notify -> close`).

Example Patch:

```json
{
  "type": "PATCH",
  "path": "tree/spaces/marketing/campaigns/23",
  "operation": "ADD",
  "value": {
    "name": "New Campaign",
    "status": "draft"
  }
}
```

### **Step 2: Inferring Intent and Activities**

By clustering and analyzing patches, we identify:

1. **Activity Clusters**:
    - Patches targeting similar parts of the tree (e.g., `/spaces/marketing/campaigns`) indicate a specific domain or
      workflow.
2. **Lifecycles**:
    - Tracks functional chains (e.g., `notify -> update`) to understand processes.
3. **Entities**:
    - Extract common data objects or metadata to define entities (e.g., `Campaign`).

### **Step 3: Dynamic Schema Generation**

Inferred entities, relationships, and operations are converted into **GraphQL schemas.**

#### Example Inferences to Schema

From the example patches above:

- **Observed Activity**: Frequent updates to `campaigns` with operations like `ADD` and `EDIT`.
- **Generated GraphQL Schema**:
   ```graphql
   type Campaign {
     id: ID!
     name: String!
     status: String
   }

   type Mutation {
     addCampaign(name: String!, status: String!): Campaign
     editCampaign(id: ID!, name: String, status: String): Campaign
   }
   ```

## **Schema Optimization**

1. **Continuous Analysis**:
    - Compare generated schemas to successful patterns in popular services (e.g., e-commerce, CRM).
    - Use the analysis to recommend new schema designs or restructuring.

2. **Example: Aligning Schema with CRM Patterns**
    - If patches indicate frequent user-assignment flows, convert these into mutations like:
      ```graphql
      type Mutation {
        assignUserToTask(taskId: ID!, userId: ID!): Task
      }
      ```

## **Tools to Leverage**

1. **Yjs** (for real-time patch synchronization)
2. **TensorFlow.js** (for clustering and inference)
3. **GraphQL Nexus** (for dynamic schema creation)
4. **Hasura** (for auto-generating CRUD operations from inferred entities)

---

## **Next Steps**

1. Integrate the patch observation layer to cluster functional chains.
2. Build an engine to dynamically generate and optimize GraphQL schemas.
3. Continuously refine schemas or suggest API restructuring.
