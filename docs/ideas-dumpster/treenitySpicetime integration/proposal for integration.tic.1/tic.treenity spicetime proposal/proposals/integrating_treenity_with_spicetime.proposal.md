# Proposal: Integrating Treenity with Spicetime

## Overview

This document outlines a multi-layered implementation to integrate Treenity’s patch-driven real-time state management
system with Spicetime’s React-based front end. The architecture includes **real-time communication**, **unified spaces
**, and a permission-aware schema design, while maintaining scalability and separation of responsibilities.

---

## 1. High-Level Architecture

1. **Treenity Layer (Low-level Patch System)**:
    - Backbone of the system managing **real-time data synchronization** and **tree-like structures** using patches.
    - Interacts with React directly for state management and updates.

2. **GraphQL Schema Layer**:
    - Abstraction layer for **services, entities**, and operations.
    - Exposes Treenity nodes + business logic declaratively.
    - Modular permission system integrated at the **space** and **schema** levels.

3. **Spaces and Borders**:
    - Logical grouping of entities into "Spaces."
    - Define clear "Borders" (permissions) for each space and schema.

4. **React Frontend**:
    - Dynamically updates its state with **streams of patches** (via WebSockets).
    - Queries GraphQL for higher-level abstractions or batch-fetch operations when needed.

## 2. Layers in Detail

### Layer 1: Treenity Patch Protocol

#### Purpose

- To enable **high-frequency, real-time, incremental updates** for the dynamic tree representing all entities/processes.
- Provide efficient and transparent distributed node synchronization.

#### Implementation Details

- **WebSocket-based Streaming Protocol**:
    - Patches and changes propagate across the distributed net.
    - Example operations include `ADD`, `EDIT`, `DELETE`.

#### Example WebSocket Implementation

- **Patch Stream Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "type": "PATCH",
    "path": "tree/path/to/node",
    "operation": "ADD",
    "value": {
      "name": "newNode",
      "data": {
        "key": "value"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### Layer 2: GraphQL Schema Layer

#### Purpose

- Provide a declarative, structured API for clients or external consumers.
- Integrate permission system centrally.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Unified Nodes**:
    - Map nodes to meaningful entities via types.
2. **Space Schema**:
    - Group a collection of nodes/entities into logical **spaces**.
    - Spaces can represent specific domains, services, or features.
3. **Permission-Aware Queries**:
    - A built-in permission system declaratively enforces boundaries.

#### Example Schema Snippet

```graphql
type Query {
  getNode(path: String!): Node
}
type Mutation {
  performAction(path: String!, chain: String!): Node
}
```

## 3. Benefits

1. **Multi-layered design** ensures scalability.
2. Highly **reactive patch-driven updates** allow seamless state changes in React.
3. **Modular permission system** guarantees security and space-oriented borders.
