When a patch with the following data is received:

```json
{
  "type": "PATCH",
  "path": "tree/spaces/marketing/tasks/101",
  "operation": "EDIT",
  "value": {
    "status": "in-progress"
  }
}
```

### Resulting Change:
```json
{
  "tree/spaces/marketing/tasks/101": {
    "name": "Campaign Planning",
    "status": "in-progress"
  }
}
```

## **3. Protocol Operations**

### **Supported Patch Operations**

| **Operation** | **Description**                                   | **Example**                                                                |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ADD`         | Adds a new node or property.                      | Add a new task to `/spaces/marketing/tasks`.                               |
| `EDIT`        | Modifies an existing property or set of values.   | Update the `status` of a task to `completed`.                              |
| `DELETE`      | Removes a node or property.                       | Delete task `101` from `/spaces/marketing/tasks`.                          |
| `MOVE`        | Moves a node from one path to another.            | Move task `101` from `/tasks/review` to `/tasks/completed`.                |
| `EXECUTE`     | Trigger an action or invoke a downstream service. | Execute a workflow on path `/spaces/sales/orders/15/submit`.               |

## **4. Real-Time Stream Implementation**

The real-time protocol utilizes **WebSocket** for low latency updates.

### **Steps for Integration**:

1. **WebSocket Connection**:
   Establish a persistent WebSocket connection between server and client.

2. **Push Patches**:
   Server streams patches to connected clients for applied changes.

3. **Client-Side Update**:
   Each client listens to incoming patches and applies them to its local state/store.

---

### **Client Patch Listener Example**
Hereâ€™s an example setup for handling patches on the client using WebSocket:

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://treenity-server/patches');

// Listens for incoming patches
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const patch = JSON.parse(event.data);
  handlePatch(patch);
};

const handlePatch = (patch) => {
  const { path, operation, value } = patch;

  switch (operation) {
    case 'ADD':
      console.log(`Adding new node at path: ${path}`, value);
      break;

    case 'EDIT':
      console.log(`Editing node at path: ${path}`, value);
      break;

    case 'DELETE':
      console.log(`Deleting node at path: ${path}`);
      break;

    case 'MOVE':
      console.log(`Moving node to path: ${path}`, value);
      break;

    default:
      console.warn(`Unknown operation: ${operation}`);
  }
};
```

## **5. Synchronizing Across Multiple Nodes**

### **Conflict Resolution**
1. **Timestamps**:
   - Use the `timestamp` field to resolve conflicts between competing updates (latest takes precedence).

2. **Operational Transform**:
   - For collaborative edits, consider using an OT-based algorithm to maintain data consistency.

### **Example: Resolving Conflict**
Two patches arrive:
1. Patch 1: `{ "path": "tree/tasks/1", "operation": "EDIT", "value": { "status": "in-progress" }, "timestamp": 1000 }`
2. Patch 2: `{ "path": "tree/tasks/1", "operation": "EDIT", "value": { "status": "completed" }, "timestamp": 1005 }`

Result:
- Patch 2 takes precedence, as its timestamp is newer.

## **6. Benefits of the Patch Protocol**

1. **Real-Time Sync**:
   - Low latency updates ensure clients have up-to-date data.

2. **Efficient Data Management**:
   - Incremental patches reduce the need to transmit entire objects.

3. **Scalable Collaboration**:
   - Distributed systems can synchronize changes efficiently over WebSocket streams.

4. **Conflict Prevention**:
   - Using timestamps and operational transforms maintains consistency across nodes.

---

## **Next Steps**

1. Implement WebSocket connection pooling for better scalability.
2. Wrap the listener logic in a reusable hook (e.g., `usePatchStream`) for client applications.
3. Extend the protocol to support batch processing for high-frequency operations.
