I understand how treenity works, dont bother. still shaky how you hook functions to nodes, or is it links?
Maybe clarify that
but i see Treenity component wrappint Spicetime or HiveMind. The tree is inside as children components, or distilled
version, but why bother.
Its basically my jsx string converted to a tree, which is already a tree.
So Treenity gets jsx string of its children and thats the tree it operates on
aha, theres react state not visible from jsx string,
Thats the global state of my react app, and Treenity is where that state is managed, so it has it, and its a structure,
the store
And i guess the reducer there is the api, or some funcs we use to mutate the state, but reducer pattern fits the bill
perfect
And from that we can construct gql api but thats just a side show
We dont need it internally, treenity just keeps the tree up to date its own way
So, GQL interface is for those that dont have treenity under the hood, the third party services, for example
And we connect to them by exposing our schema ,auto generated from the reducer
and that reducer is composed of modules, and thats components of functionality
Its a distillation of reducers from jsx structure, just normal redux pattern

Side thought
Maybe use redux, and all its middleware mechanics. its super useful.

Side thought
Maybe, thats how config is plugged in, like vite and typedoc and ts

Let me explain how itll work, to merge those side thoughts. Its a bit confusing without setting the right structure.

So, the right structure
theres the state tree, theres the component tree, theres the reducer tree

side thought
the triplet. How profound. components - community, state - autority, reducer - executioner,cops, executive branch
there might be other useful abstractions to build around it, but its an intresting structure, ready for a Governance
component to handle it
And governance is based on leadership
So its the triplet the US constitution uses, with a bit more added to it, but thats a good start.
And the leaders are people that manage the three structures, and chosen by their skills, and their culture and attitudes
shape the culture of community, so it directly translates to the social chromodynamics, for this is a fractal pattern of
management, of react components, and society, and orgs, and countries

back, from the stack

side thought
this is how we will manage tangents.
They are recursive calls to updateIdeaDumpster, prbly a reducer func
but in text, it can be in markdown, html like structure, xml?
no, too much, an extended md format, a shorthand, just like im doing here, but with some escape mechanism,
like $ indicates commands,eg $back $aside $proposal
and AI agent monitors and executes in realtime
So, not calls to updateIdeaDumpster, but that and other reducer funcs, guided by $ml
those $ tags are componets, with their own logic, react up and down the spine and down the neck to the toes, thru the
vanes, to the heart, and brain, and oozing out of our ears

so yes, $ml is a component, with Back and Aside and Proposal as its compound children

$back
Treenity, thru treenity, maintains those two parallel sibling structures, nodes
but it has to be careful WHEN mutations are allowed
Its the matter of life cycle
never mind previous stuff ☺️
its evolving, out of confusion, to more confusion, to complete mess, bingo!!!
so, life cycles is the next node/structure in the Treenity top level of its tree
now we got

* components/jsx/space
* state/store/data
* reducer/api/gql schema/gql resolvers
* life stages/time

## lets deal with life stages now

its a state machine, but lets not introduce another entetie and structure, we got react, and we just pick a StateMachine
component off the google shelf or npm and thats the Time component

$note
But what the heck, lets just spec it out and let claude build it, quicker

$aside
note might form a layer of meta over the context
in a viewer, it will overlay notes and other layers over the text, showing clue blips ,or on status bar, or in a docked
window,webstorm style
and notes and asides and comments will render in separate windows.
yeah, todo is a good one, tied up to project management system
and its proactive layers, ai actually does it, in an interactive way
so, you put aside there and George pops up and ask how high to jump, no... asks where to place it, unless its obvious
from previous context or you specifies in the aside tag attributes

$action
add $todo tag and integrate with project management
add attribute capability to iml - idea markdown language

$aside
iml is idea markdown language
its purpose is to help AI doing semantic analysys and directing its actions and responses to minimize prompt/answer
cycles and prevent halucinations and reduce its workload and optimize inference space, by telling ot exactly what to do
and structuring ideas and context and specifiing how to expand the structure of ideas and what actions to take.
basicaly managing work, thru ai assistant, without leaving the editor, uninterupted , doing all at once, like me here

$back to Treenity

$note
look at back command above. it has a to attribute and Treenity as its value. granted its not tagged as attribute, for
its redundant. ai should understand it, being in one line, in a tag context, and it sounds symanticaly correct anyway,
why break simplicity with confusing tags, but a normal cli option standard can be applied, eg --to Treenity
now Treenity is the title of the branch
we declare title, either at the very start by a simple name on the first line or a title tag followed by title itself
then we do 'aside someSubTitle' or 'aside on ...' or 'aside --on ...'

$action

* add action tag
* add attribute syntax similar to cli options as attributes, but make it contextual, so its not dogmatic and super
  demanding, but understands when i miss -- where it makes sense
* add --no <title> to aside
* add --to <prevTitle> to back
* add --on <title> to note
* add comment tag, will have optional --on <prevTitle> attribute
  Exactly. So we should create community workshop!
  $back to Treenity

$action on iml

* add --on <title> to action
* add 'add --to <prevTitle | title> --on <subTitle | prevSubTitle>' tag
  add to <new title> is same as aside on <new title>
* maintain local structure of titles and subtitles, to be properly restructured and located to live tree later

## no lets build that state machine in react

that state machine is Clock
the previous 'time' node in treenity tree is process
its a structure, and each

$add to iml on overview
iml is not a platform specific tool, just like md/gfm
but it comes with its own runtime, which is part of HiveMind and spicetimeReactApp it runs in
it actually lords over the laptop you are working on, and monitors your active window, and picks up and executes those iml commands prompto, in real time
and thats just one base functionality
Theres a voice plugin that does the same off voice prompts, in context of what you writing, or any other current activity.
yes, its that smart to knoiw what you are doing, and its predictive and reflective and self concious,but thats other plugins down the roadmap
so
$action

* obviously, if i skip to attribute, thats cos its inherited from the parent add tag right above
  so, add that functionality to design
* action tag means add to design section
  same as add to design
* action has optional --on <subTitle | prevSubTitle>
  The Forge)
  I thought of it many times. The Portal built by users.
  And other users propose changes to portal
  and we vote,
  and change the portal itself
  DAO Portal
  yes. its a dao, with governance structure, but marketplace is a separate component. lets keep it structured
  sure. they can use it as source of the briks
  what we creating is a jsx structure of components, but someone else can create a dif structure by extention
  jsx structure of the platform
  yes
  ok, it is. it already now.
  its a process. what im writing in my prev comments, i shouild be doing in webstorm, is the design of that process and
  the structure
  it integrates treenity and spicetime. i was breaking my head over it, but im finally getting it
  What about updated jsx: <someId TheType prop=... />
  of course, its dynamic, over life stages as well as space
  field first. is the same as
  {
  someId: TheType(props),
  }
  yeah, its just a react component
  and what is beautiful about this structure: you always could get some path
  root.someId.otherField
  whole thing runs in browser, perhaps a headless browser on occasion
  anything is adressable
  exactly. it fits to treenity like a leaf on a tree
  and everything still typed and checked. but also could be dynamic. and extendable realtime
  so dont bother with last few days. i put a lot of tics in that structure in my repo
  what tics?
  look at my commits
  thats my new babe, structure of time
  look at structure. forget the content
  its odatedut
  gist is
  GQL is a sideshow
  treenity rules
  that drives the point in
  workflows, processes, their structure, need to be dynamic, under local control, and composable from marketplace
  components
  but that time structure, with tics and nodes, facilitates the research and organizers context i carry over to branch
  projects, as previous artifacts, soi dont have to repeat the whole thing like a dumb parrot
  i have solid ideas about it. its part of my architecture.
  Ill start feeding you docs out of my structure, just links
  Its shaping up taking form
  but, my thoughts:
  its a roadmap
    * develope marketplace component
      1.it provides domains of market structure at first
      but its extendable component. its not my concern what others might need and do. All i know is what i do. Evolution
      happens by forking and extension
      we might ,;ater, introduce agents that suggest and even put their own components on market. thats how ai gets
      involved.
      But, i dont wanna plan for a dynamic structuring of all core peices. thats a recursive call that never comes
      back!!!!
        2. it integrates with HiveMind component to provide global context
        3. it integrates with DevelopmentEnvironment component
           to provide collaboration and sharing of ideas in a constructive way. but, its not a webDev version. its
           styled as marketplace

$note

* we will use css patterns to propagate props and attributes, to break up the tirany of never ending space of jsx
  structure of components and props
* components are real DOM elements, like div and navs
* we will leave css and style attribute alone, to do its intended job, and introduce stStyle attribute, as example, but
  there might be a structure of these things, it never ends.
  and stStyle is a component that regulates propagation and inheritance of our custom attributes thru browser elements
* thus we will extend the DOM, with custom events and custom behaviour, andp combining these type of things into MyDOM
  component ;)
  *so stStile={type:marketplace} is applied to DevEnvironment, emotion like, via css prop behavior
* so we will extend emotion package to provide custom css like props, and thats the Emotion component
  *.this smacks of a configuration ilk
  emotion is a dep, and would take a config file to adjust its local behaviour, but we will just wrap entire project in
  Emotion and then each core component will understand its context and adjust its behaviour wo any additional wrappings,
  but if custom solutions are introduced, they will create variants of core components thru HOC mechanism
  So, this is a zero config config approach in a nutshell, and Nutshell is a .... just kidding
    4. it integrates with EthicsScore components to provide ethical weghts on all market transaction via individual
       social score($see EthicsScore implementation)
    5. it integrates to OpenLiscencse and SmartContract and DreamWeaver and DreamCatcher
* develope Maintainance component
    1. it, thru knowledge of global context/state analysers developing needs and deficiencies and opportunities for new
       tools and improvements to old tools
    2. it suggests these tools as collaborative ventures to most possible and qualified individuals or teams, and if no
       takers, develops them itself, and places them on market, to be subject to market forces and opportunities and
       processes
       $note
       so that takes care of adapting core components. Not my concern ;)
       built by users is puzzling. i wrote above about evolving core components.
       you suggesting users evolving their ownser interface to that portal/marketplace
       Ill go along with that, but thats separate from volving the core of Marketplace. that should be done by
       marketplace itself, thru a forking process, extending and creating new tools, abiding by open source licenses
       smart contracts that enforce them.
       And ai is heavily involved, by designing its own tools and placing them on market, a central hub of innovation,
       no exceptions
       i understand. sorry i missed your insite before. confusing in a linear fashion and with a comm lag.
       You are converting jsx to structure. Yes, i totally get it. jsx is nothing but a spacelike structure and is super
       easy to convert back and forth and react prbly exposes its structures. its called shadow DOM
       we should get it thru react, so we dont have to maintain that utility
       that path is a functional chain. react composes funcs thru these jsx defined functional chains
       in essence, jsx is a block representation of a process spicetime, structured into allpossible timelines and
       provided with conditional logic of branching
       Its a frigging process, each jsx app
       Routes are some distinct view points in that universe
       UI inputs are what drives the process, from each view point specified by Router
       Its brilliantly adapted to browser environment
       and we should and will use the same stricture to declare our processes, but we dont focus just on browser. We
       have other layers
       I already covered it extensively
       so yes, any path in spicetime is a func chain, with components attached, and fed into the browser, so its all
       visualized and all that stuff
       but it also is fed to project management layer. it renders a project cvs file, or directly mutates a project in
       openProject or in next cloud. But thats not good practice. It has to buffer it and interact and make
       adjustments - reflect
       so, you see, now we have, or close to
* creating a project and
* start divvying up tasks to collaborators.

you already have a company and workers. Im gearing up my environment to

* accept those workers and collaborators, and will
* start generating cash,

$note
thru beer sales if i have to;))

and thats the next phase
😜legitemizing the hippies
and
we need a conract between us
just an open source licence and later a smart contract on top of that
we are not splitting/forking
we are merging at this point
thats a different scenario and i have not considered it yet

Thoughts?
a common repo, a monorepo
why dont we use my spicetime-architecture

* i fork treenity or whatever needed
* under your liscence
* and we form a DAO and the smart contract that managers that liscence
  oh my, a discovery
* routers are view points
* people have view points
* those points view their perspective
* each spicetime ReactApp, in each node, such as phone, will have multiple ViewPoint, a router like component
* What are those view points?
  1.view points on various domains of interest
    2. view points of other people, as percieved by the person
       thats the TheoryOfMind component grounds. Gotta have it, as a child of ...

$title Empathy component

* it will have children component
    1. TheoryOfMind
       managers models of other spicetime view points, ViewPoint components, of friends and neighbours, dogs and
       crazies, street folks and dear leaders, and all the freeloading figures
       $title ViewPoint component
       managers a local spicetime tree of another node
       a representation, not a mirror
       a personal perception of what other head might look like from inside
* it will have the spicetime tree inside
* perhaps a link of a placeholder is enough
* that link gets a query result, out of graph db, with
  *which is a rendered product of a

$title PersonalPerception module
$note
this needs work. theres a personal model of someones head, and theres an interactive session with other guy agent, and
even the guy himself
thats a cool idea, tho
So, that DAO is the club ,like my Brew Club for beer.
and it has its own marketplace, which is extention of someone else marketplace, and its a child of Marketplace component
in a local spicetimeReactApp, and each user customizers its marketplace

So when he signs up to a club, club marketplaces is dropped into his Marketplace

$Note
Theres a process to dropping a component into a live jsx string.
The app has to transition to dev stage, component is dropped into the structure, app goes to build stage, rebuilds
itself, hot reloads, and now its back online.
Obviously, it takes a DevEnvironment component, and its a added option, and it does not just have a static
spicetimeReactApp sitting in its local repo. It has a component inside, that discovers and gets one of repo variants on
the market, or the one stashed locally, and iit renders that repo structure, straight into, might be a virtual file
system, dont have to pollute the guys phone.

$note
The app is served out of local dev server, why not. theres no dedicated cloud server, unless the guy is willing to pay
for hosting, then we have our own hosting service and collect the fee, but we are rapping a Heroku or something, and add
a bit extra for the fee. he can get his own tho. Or it can be a gh pages site, but those are one per user and , why not,
thats a perfect way to host it, so its available 24/7. but the app will still do the dev stage till the guy is happy,
then deploy to gh, bu pushing it.
and its a gatsby site
So, the whole of spicetime is hosted by github, for free. Yeap
Oh yeah, the app will do doc stage to generate the docs, which is where his personal blog is, and spicetimeReactApp is
one of routes in that blog, as a portal to his mind, accessible to the HiveMind, of others
And thats how the whole thing is linked together
And it all happens organically when they wanna start brewing beer and find the app in play store, and they get sucked
into spicetime, for life.
Theres no escape.
And once they in, brainwashing begins. Just kidding, they get hooked and become part of community, and they have to be
ethical to be part of the community and they join other DAOs and form their own, and we change their thinking and shape
their culture and we make them rich, but we dont take the credit. Its his doing, we are the catalyst of change.

So now, hes a club member and has a vote in decision making, but his vote is weighted by his club score, his ethics
score, weighted by claub standards
i have a precise way to compose those community standards
👍
Its a gaming engine
How would we use it?
Gaming is a huge resource of truly performant and novel ideas and tools
i kinda understand what you saying, but prbly not all
i need more context. what issue are you solving
is that part of your new TreeRPC?
Yes, i hope. It is like gql resolvers tree, but dynamic and with active entity
And cool client library
Yes. We will use as the base of the world constructed
Not exactly unity itself but the architecture of it. Composable components.
of course we will. sounds just what spicetime needs to guard its borders. well call it SecurityGuard or
NeighbourhoodWatch or just Border. How about API
i gotta check it out. sounds intriguing
So, how would we structure it?
Create all our nodes inside it, or it provides some kinda HOC component?
if it does not, thats what we need to create
that means its easy. we can always make those react components
we can use it only for specific cases, regions of space, just a thought
this thing can be used internally. thats what i was looking for to replace all that config mess. well stick vite and the
rest of that bunch into that and expose them thru that api interface, and the thing ncan go nuts inside beating up vite
and typedoc, i dont car. they deserve it. itll just abuse them with virtual files that go in and out of existence
just a note, so you understand my perspective
Theres no common community portal ui
each member can mutate that protal
Each runs his own app, not sharing one on a server
unless specifically setup to use an external server, and community servers can be setup, but default is a dev server on
the phone, or on gh pages, exposing his gateway to outside, but his private stuff runs in phone, and it does not need to
be online all the time. he can have his private network and shard his ai model within his network
And i wanna point out another thing
each will provide and consume DiAI services thru his agent
and its the market thing
itll mbe served off the phone or his private net, not pages
and hell be paid for tokens weighted by his availability and adjusted for rush hour and he gets a service rating and a
boost if he provides availability.
and thats the pattern. each gets it his way. its his perspective. you dont go to community to make a dinner your way, do
you?
im dead serious aboiut making universe the right way. it is a universe, in every sense of it, by any measure. theres no
difference. it WILL have same laws of nature
and not some time after it matures, and lets just do it the easy nway right now. None of that, itll be done right from
get go. structure is not easily mutable once it sets up. and it never completely recovers, especially from the original
sin. Thats why our universe is crewed up,it came from sin. They are right about it.
its called initial conditions. it sets direction of evolution.
and thats the answer to your security concern. Your private data, your context is not shared with anyone. It always
stays local, and priv ate, and protected, and comms are scrambnled and decentralized and always in a flux so no one can
sniff structure by opatches it consumes. its all dynamic and obfuscated, like dynamic crypto keys, ascillating at max
speed. no ai can keep up with that. they have crack all the disparate patches going all over for unknown reasons and
everything is scarmable, including ip addresses. and ai controls it all, cos noone else can
