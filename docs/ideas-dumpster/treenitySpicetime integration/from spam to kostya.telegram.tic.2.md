so, i might be totally wrong. give me a use case that shows why.
The reason i keep pecking bon gql, its universal like react, really easy to get acceptance, the buy in, despite any of
its flaws. its got a huge ecosystem and allows us leveraging great tools out there. Frankly, i have no idea how to
proceed without it. explain if you disagree. Im not ready to go back to APIs. its a mess
i dont ever expect creating these schemas manually, its just a stage in a process to me, to be encapsulated into a
component. there are plenty of other snags and odd things there and it all is solved by creating processes, not just
client apps for the productionstage. an app is a react process, everything for grabs and mutable. ill get the thing to
pet your cat for you if you stick a manipulator arm off aliexpress on your mavbook
the biggest value to me, you guys will be maintaining that part of my architecture, and thats huge and the best way for
us to collaborate with defined concerns and boundaries. Im sure whatever the heck it does, is fine. im just anxious to
adjust my architecture and keep on going. im kinda in limbo.
so, ill push what i got and go to bed.
go thru it so you understand why my head is twsten the wrong way and why im getting it all wrong :)
im sure there are some gems in there.
so, ok
i started thinking in use cases about it and heres what im zeroing into
Its really my issue how im gonna plug into treenity.
Its fullof opportunities and pitfalls
Hes my immutable principles

* spicetime is agnostic of treenity or anything else serving needed functionalities
* React is the universal language of spicetime
  GQL is not immutable principle, but its the only consistent universal interface standard im providing. anyone else can
  write tools to create another interface layer. Im not interested, but make sure it is universal and provide a gql
  converter, or you gonna get derated in your score, but its tricky for gotta be a way to migrate and branch to other
  tools wo breaking universal compatability.
* so another principle, there has to be a path totranslate between interfaces like treenity and gql, but spicetime has
  its own abstraction, and write now it wraps gql 100%, and treenity will be converted to spicetime, meaning to gql
  under the hood
* the lesson and emrging principle is --- all core functionalities of spicetime are its own, wrapping something else of
  course, but universe has to be self contained , self concious, and has its own purpose, so wrap it does, into its meta
  layer

So, treenity and GQL are just tools under the hood, perhaps even competing at times, buty only one choice will be
provided in MVP
But gql might be exception, cos its unclear what benefits might arise from use of either tool and possible synergy is
tickling my vision

so, spicetime architecture remains intact, tools get rearranged and exact structure its unclear, but thats not an
immidiate concern, as any missing functionality can be mocked, to meet the needs of spicetime api

gql language is NOT official language of spicetime, as it is not married to it.Treenity is NOT required to speak GQL. It
is required to speak SQL, spicetime quiry language
SQL is same as jsx, so it might be easier to learn, but treenity must extend those SQL components or provide a plugin
that is basicaly middleware

and spacetime is open to proposals to accept jsx structure of its SQL based on trinity abstractions. Then we will
convert that into GQL, for it is a universally accepted standard and treenity and spicetime are not. gotta dress as a
roman when in a collisium ruins

conclusions and benefits
dont need conclusions, i already said it
Benefits is my sanity is intact, atleast not worse then before.
I cant handle ground shifting under me. i worked hard to rich solid soil, and im not going back to sea.
separation of concerns, establishment of spicetime identity
creating clear boundaries and lines of engagement
a naturally arising plan of action based on major philosophical principles, rooted in the parent higher scope
so listen, im back from playing the god from above.
I think its a peice of cake. well use treenity to cook up a window/layer where we compose jsx components of general API,
and itll several pallets and flavors, gql, treenity , and theres no SQL. itll just take whatever is coming and convert
to whatever is needed by the user and itll bark back in whatever the user wants. be my guest.
so we can prbly automate api building, using structure to generate api out of local nodes, condensing it from the nodes,
thru the tree, and its just a layer view, showing tree as api components. lets try and see if we can break it. and its
the general design, agnostic of the tech. you could render it either treenity or gql
its not so crazy. all the org processes and workflows are part of the structure and api surface is readily exposed in
one layer or another, and our builder will just coordinate between layers and life stages in a proper timelines and
space snapshots navigating between layers and displaying the underlying api surface. there are might be some typical
visualizations. its not a universal thing, but a domain driven, so, another composition of domains. those are org types,
perhaps, or hobby interests, templates
so, spicetie does not have a language and a national anthem, its a universe. ever heard birds singing national anthem,
or marsians speaking esperanto?
it speaks YOUR language, cos its YOUR perspective in the universe. THATS WHY
im happy again. let it peace on us, piece by piece, at its own pace, in your own style, inside common mind
but, it might be a lot easier to explain to claude that app mis gql rather then non existing SQL, so itll be designed
with gql as a saas architecture
unless you show me a better way
anyway, i dont care. its irrelevant. it just talks across the nodes, thats all i know
wait, every node has an api surface, and it just propagates thru the structure. thisn is the cross product of permition
and messaging system, daah
i bet theres a mathematical operation that producers api surfaces and defines entity borders, operating on permition and
field. well keep going and keep an eye open. a few use cases might just weed that lunatic out
