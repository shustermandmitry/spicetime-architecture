but treenity can be used for ui level, and any other tools. Its gonna be a marketplace of tools, and anything goes

But if tools work, they are the first adaptors and become dominant in the market

And tools will be rated and given the ethical score, generated consumer index,GCI And whole universe of history and
resons behind each adjustments and dispute resolution and quick feedback mechanism, to keep everyone in the loop,
connecting debtors and creditors and politicians to each of us indivudually, a direct line, at least to his agent with
up to date context and a rating power, to judge him and you, a recursive system of ratings. rating is a process, whwre
it interacts with itself as it develops. that purely smacks of quantum gravity. highly nonlinear self interacting
affecting geometry. all apply, and a scalar field of ratings. scores are distance from personal position to community
setpoint, in 3d of ethics. so the field is never absolute, relative to each node. thats a symmetry. i think it creates a
spinnless particle, a graviton. that means there are no rotational generators, its completely symmetrical in all
directions of rotation. spin is when you go half turn in any rotational axis and hit a mirror condition. thats spin 1/2,
thats bosons, like photons. when you hit a mirror image opposite in phase, thats a boson, electrons and quarks. and
those generated by other symmetries, for its composable. component symmetries apply to different layers of the graph.
that just makes sense to me
one more i wanna add
evolving it is not our concern. itll take care of itself with or without us. We reshaping the way it does business, the
structure of vacuum, we change culture. Thats almost instant, like the big bang, a seed, inflation, done. then it
evolves by new rules in new direction
oh i see. you talking about all the isms
Yeah, i hate those with a strong passion
I wanna really rub it in, and gloat over it
im gonna spit on anyone who gives me an ...ism label, i promise you that
those bastards that push that crap killed billions already. gotta end
try to think without language. lmk how it went
names is all we have to understand anything
thats whybtreenity. it does it right. in functional way, respecting time and space
that does not match observations. the markets around the world move on a dime, quicker then software can follow. it
drives and shapes human societies. how can you say its gonna take millions of years? But we have to create DiAI agent
that scales thru peoples phones and communicates super efficiently and adapts to the changing net super fast. analogous
to human brains
you know how?
we gonna take tolmud and create a smart contract based on it, GQL schema of tolmud, and we gonna take law codexes and do
the same and the ten commendments, and itll be the point of departure in every societal domain. we gonna give russians
the perfect communism and americans the perfect capitalism and they gonna merge and forget the stupid labels within a
year
the KEY is the right abstraction, and the spacetime and all my bfantasies are just that, to ground tech gobledygook to
peoples level. everyone understands how reality works. every religion gets the model of reality exactly right. we have
to follow and respect that, not fight it
it did take nature billions of years to evolve us, then we evolved our culture in thousands of years to a diversity much
higher then speciations of animals
Now we can do the rest in years. lets just create a frictionless ethics based infrastructure and let it go. itll evolve
itself with a purpose and vigor that will blow your sucks off. i guarantee you, if we do it right
thats the bSelfConcious part
but it can monitor in the background and suggest or even create new tools to match the needs and developing patterns,
and make money for itself on market
and yeah, they are inherited and composed, so ai does not have to work so hard, just advice humans when they fork an
enterprise on open soutrce liscence
those schemas can be smart contracts
yeah. scemas dont have to change quick and always interactively with human owners
yes, AI could create schemas for us. take it easy. wait not long
does that make sense?
i have to think it thru. it was just a vision. I think each functionality is a domain, a direction in space
theres a flux of treenity patches from each direction
the patterns of those strings form a gql schema structure
and ai creates those schemas and resolvers
im a hard core pragmatist, face in the money pile. we gonna make people rich quick
people will respond to economic stimulus, instantly. money talks
yes, implementing is easy, creating the distributed ai to keep track of measurables out of everyone context is hard, and
i need treenity to link all those nodes together
ok) lets make the tools, which will help you to implement
no what are you talking about. i wanna shape taxes. i wanna be irs
It is too hard for me)
do you want to become god?))
the personal ethical score weghted by community cultural shape
you will need millions of years of compute time to organize and evolve the inner structure of your universe)
Calculate what?)
<personal ethics domain matrix in domain i> -> Epi
<community domain values vector> ->CultureShape->CS->[DW1,DW2,...DWn]
DWi -> weight in domain i

anyway, its a matrix op, kinda like a quantum measurement op, but i dont know how complex numbers get in there. its
possible but who cares, just shut up and calculate
so I think) it is better to go make the realisation. in the form we understand now, that just imagine things we not yet
understand =)
not everything open to everything, and now we are making just cluster of the ecosystem
you have no the center of the universe, but we have clusters and ecosystems.
maybe separated from each other. (it is easy)
it can be just different layers of the tree
extending it, just add node and put telegram bot inside, it will be the root of that bot. But also you could add some
docs, inside the bot-pages structure
you can just add поведение to the objects
The 3d massive multiplayer RPG game, cluster was made like this
Unity 3D, the most (one of) used 3D engine made like this
the most natural way to construct things
like GPS coordinates, or address, or description, of comments line, or file attachments
so, you have some exact object, but also can add some typed data to it, to add some info
but everything can be composition not inheritence
or TGQL
it is static, but with ability to change. and. ALL is typed. as dynamic gql, you know, DGQL
How will you implement gql low-code editor? if all static?
a sub is like a focused laser beam, or a dedicated fiber cable between you and the other node. theres a place for that,
but the light of day does not subscibe to infinity, it just shines and reflects and get retransmitted and get focused in
beams, and used for discovery and it cant penetrate nonpermissive entities and some just gobble the light and stay
silent and undiscoverable. thats how messaging and permitions are closely related and community has its standards of
access and openness and the ethics scoring reflects those standard, i have a way to effect tgat in a composable way, and
people will get rated for their oopenness and closeness to community standards in domain of wh they chose to listen, a
football star, a flashy pop singer or you and me, no but someone wise with a high score in wisdom domain
its a domain based scoring system, and everyones ethics score is aggregated, measured, thru the domains of community
culture, layers of the graph, by a community mesuring apparatus, the community desired cultural shape, a collection of
weights for each domain. its a simple matrix operation, a matrix op.

<personal normalized ethics vector>=<personal ethics domain matrix nx3> X <community domain value vector n> / n
so think about it and see how it can be finetuned to your abstractions
and now we have a geometrical structure of schemas, and thats how our discovery mechanism gonna work and how distances
between enteties like orgs are calculated, the metrics
and that has nothing to do with GQL schamas somewhere. totally agnostic, but a schema can be generated around any volume
of that space. its totally geometrical
and then the messaging system and permition system from local perspective, and we got all we need, in single seed node
and the enrgy is measured by how much space a tic creates when it executes its func, for more then one space node can
get created, there are strings inside strings, you see, a structure, and the info of that structure is the energy, and
its just pure math, splitting content into semantic embeddings of roughly equal informational volume, and calculating
how many bits it takes to describe the tree structure x average info content of grains, the embeddings. and now we got
metric of space and time and energy flow thru it. and claude will whip out field equations, hes good at it
that is real elegant.
without gql borders theres no space and theres no notion of metric. that space time conversion mechanism is not gonna do
it. its not declarative, spontanious, its just what universe does with or without humans in it. its how it evolves, pure
vaccuum, expanding into inflating space, out of energy of incomin info, mutating affected time into space. thats the
inflation potential, coming from the past, from meta. for all the tics go into archive of past, and thats abstracted as
meta
thats another part of spacetime schema, maybe its the resolver part of it, whatever.

its your strings that drive time to space conversion. they carry patches that add to node timelines and generate tics
and when funcs of those tics get executed, the tic goes to space. thats the motive power, the funcs that lurk behind the
names in the string, the functional chain strings
ну давай я тебя еще помучаю
and this will give us GR, и не ходи к бабке за этим
its lorentsian cos its strictly local
but then, there ar mutations in that schema that allows time to space translation, in Lorentsian sense. Thats how space
nodes are created out of tics in time structure. a tic happens when it wants to eject space cancer out of its content.
That cancer chunk its cutting out is tic name, for the child it creates. you can see it in tic folder extentions, eg
tic.1.spam-patch so the patch goes on its own when it gets name 'spam-patch' and thats the time-space translation, thats
alll folks
look at my last commits, and try to follow that tic structure. Thats the structure of time. it goes into GQL schema, and
we done
give me a link to your docs, and this opus goes to olyx. lets see what Misha cooked up there
and thats a perfect separation of concerns of treenity and rigidity, of fluidity and sanity
so, the universal distributed spicetimeReact app gets its context from treenity layer below it, and thats the soil it
grows out of, the feeding substrat. and that context flows freely thru gql or however else, cos its a set universal
standard not subject to change, a universal contract. Time is local, but structure of time is universal, and we can make
it a backbone of any gql interface and it is not fluid and treenity flows thru it (well get Robert Redford to pop up and
say it every time someone opens that layer window) This is the stargate, and GQL subs are hooked to it, and not anywhere
else. so all reactivity is thru treenity
and the beauty of this, we dont have to explain to all those devs stuck between GQL borders in stuffy corp headquarters
how spiceTime universal context works that allows us to create their space, out of time of your function strings
hql can give us that, and we can have automated tools to build those GQL borders anywhere in space. its like membraines
thru which the flux of info/energy is going thru, and gql borders create illusions of solid objects
but if your implementation is ready, thats huge. thats at least one way to effect comms layer, and has everything i
envisioned. but im not sure how declarative it is about interfaces between enteties that matter to people
and the roles of each and the structure will evolve naturally
simply, we have both, as tools on their level of abstraction, and they compete
we simply set up unstructured sockets between nodes, in addition to GQL schemas, and thats how treenity flows free, and
let market be the judge, and executioner, rather executor.
the sockets are the gates to smart contracts and drive them no matter what GQL is guarding, creating its own alternative
structure. We gotta have polarity and electricity. just gravity is too slow and low energy
I need your API docs, thjays all i need.
Heres what i see
Not everything is so одназначно.
If everything was dynamic, there would be no

persistency in existency

The borders are murky

just shadows
The shifters

A world of a meta
We gotta do better

Simply, in prose, if everything fluid, theres no matter, or persistent entitties, like a self, or even a particle. just
chaos, quantum buble, no space and no time, no structure

So, thats where GQL stands the guard. Its so inflexible for a reason, not by design, but by universe intent, and it did
its bidding thre the necessities of the corps to maintain their identity, but kinda be able to talk to each other.

This is universal pattern, not corps fault, but a gift, of a model of reality, to us, from grifters -> to shifters

What i mean, the borders of persistent enteties gotta be declaired and maintain and guarded, Thats what GQL is for.

Treenity is the underlying infrastructure, the layer below that, but it respects the borders of declared GQL schemas, no
tunneling below the fences, but then there are things like telepathy and phycics, and we can make their abstractions
work as well, by having some meta flowing thru the cracks in the GQL wall. Itll be impossible not to. We cant tell folks
what to do, but we can give them an easy way to do it, breaking the walls, so GQL layer itself can evolve thru
competition with shadow world
we doing well. by the plan
its just a structure crawler, like babel. perhaps a babel plugin
and all the things I should fix before it started to work
yep, sometimes, i think so, but then I starting to implement and just knit in the code
thats fine. thats easily gotten
ok. please try it, want to know how fast is it possible to config
the structured data should be just typed json, with json-schema for it
but ill be doing gql for now. i cant exist in a vacuum, i gotta have something connecting the peices. its not big deal
all i got is a distributed react app and all i send back and forth are jsx and state and structured data, so oi dont
need gql and structure of mutations and queries. its an overhead translating into gql and peroviding all kind of
complexity for dynamical changes in gql schemas, it has to be dynamic for everything has to be dynamic, nothing is
sacred.
So, treenity will streamline comms to being completely transparent making everything super light nand logically thin

i spend most of my time recordinh my thoughts. its self consuming
ai needss to keep up, wo almost no input from me. then i surf the idea field in comfort and safety
exactly. thats how i picture it
you are connected to the Ideas field)
i just have too many ideas to be able to track them. i get lost within a day, the moment i get away from the screen for
an hour. its super frustrating. The ideas are so involved in deps , hard to reconstruct later
? i have to record my thoughts or i lose them and get really confused. then i start organazing them into a bit of
structure and use as context for claude projects, and eventually start implementing. Im streamlining it. thats whatb im
coding, out of frastration
or have an "config" permission
on the paths wetween nodes you own.
ypu own paths? Its a dual ownership?
yes. i have gql gateways on each node
yes. ebery node has its perspective which directly related to permitions
you can put gateway on the any path (you own)
so every gateway will have it's own permissions, given by jwts
whatever works for now, but theres no center in a universe
i have good ideas, and wrote a lot about it, but no implementation yet. its not hard
for now we will use centralized one
yeah, claude suggested it
Yep, permition system is another good question
I seen libp2p, and it is quite promising
its about permition system, flipping the concerns. and the shape of your permition system defines shape of access and
shape and depth of your percpective, rather perception and defines how opaque you are to others. how do we translate
subs into something real? i dont know
i dont like sub systems. its not scalable. ill have design of a messaging system soon. Just look how universe works. the
martians are not about to subscribe to your feed, are they?
but you just gave me idea how to make our sub system even better.
ok. ill follow your lead. whatever works best
true
we have just json-patches
but it is a pain in the ass to apply that subscriptions
in the end of January
its same gql has subscxriptions over web sockets
We will need you, when we will release beta.
But please, dont spam there yet.
https://discord.gg/Z78EwPBe
it was me halucinating. he just went along with it
please install, will send u the link
yeah, i can get it on my macbook
it is working, but to be tested and debugged for sure
ill let claude crawl the code and integrate my designs with it. itll reduce work 10x or 100x if its debugged
do u have discord?
but now gql for now, but websockets. BUT we could make it GQL easily.
but thats great. youv done all the work. i was hoping you did
i will. its just a prelim design in idea dumpster
Ok, let me see, is it working now.
I should show u
and UI editor to compose blocks
We already have real-time ai-widget generation
it is the system I already made, called Treenity.
yes, called widgets and connected to the types.
so much more useful
and templates for easy access and human interface
It is claude, but on FS repo
yep) sometimes. but it making much mistakes. you should try Cursor for coding.
react
you still need some runtyme type system for serialization.
look at implementation doc. its already done. ai you know
thats the SwampMaster concern
what about resolvers?
so, basically, i got rid of configuration completely. spicetime is zero config. all third partu integrations are thru
GQL, as service/client architectute. vite is a servivce, but a local service. its config is GQL schema and quiries
against it as needed locally. no global config Its all managed by gql and tools can be switched and mixed and matched
and when a new one pops up, the SwampMaster pops up and handles the gremlins
but, maybe ill keep it and just manipulate their config files under the hood over gql schema.
or, same for github actions. who the hell needs it. we got react and we got gh api
just bpushed it look at last commit. its got complete implementation for vite and ts integration into a monorepo. turbo
is thrown out for lack of use. we got react for that. json files they can take to their grandmom. and typedoc and
mermaid and GatsbyDocs and GQLDocs gonna be children of Config component and talk gql and listen to the teacher. im done
with thaty bunch.
do you understand what im doing? Im translating my process of finetuning that pipiline into react components and making
it a manageable and scalable process, so we can bring collaborators of any level of experience reliably and get the most
out of them. novices are cheap and easy to deal with and they have fresh perspective, if you take away all the bs that
kills their spirit
agreed. total convoluted mess. so disappointing. they did not let founders to finish js and they still cant get it
right, when pyton is just loughing its ass off. maybe we should switch. there are excellent and more performant
alternatives. we should use the best tool for the job. which is react, but rust and a few other highly specialized tolls
are gonna be important. we facing a computational bottleneck
