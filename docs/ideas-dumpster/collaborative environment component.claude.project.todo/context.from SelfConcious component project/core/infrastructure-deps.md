# Infrastructure Dependencies

Path: `/docs/collaborative-environment/core/infrastructure.md`

## Foundation Technologies

The collaborative environment leverages established distributed systems:

### Solana Blockchain

- Fast, low-cost state updates
- Smart contract foundation
- Transaction verification
- State persistence

### IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)

- Distributed content storage
- Tool and middleware distribution
- Content addressing
- Persistence guarantees

### Holonet

- Peer-to-peer networking
- Service discovery
- Distributed hosting
- Agent communication

## How We Use Them

### State Management

- Contract states on Solana
- Smart contract hierarchy implementation
- Transaction verification and logging
- Fast state synchronization

### Content Distribution

- Tool code stored on IPFS
- Middleware packages distribution
- Content-addressed resources
- Immutable package versions

### Network Operations

- Peer discovery via Holonet
- Service advertising and finding
- Distributed message routing
- Node communication

## Benefits

1. **Established Patterns**
    - Battle-tested infrastructure
    - Existing tooling and patterns
    - Active development communities
    - Proven security models

2. **Performance**
    - Fast state updates (Solana)
    - Efficient content distribution (IPFS)
    - Scalable networking (Holonet)

3. **Reliability**
    - Multiple persistence layers
    - Distributed redundancy
    - Network resilience
    - State consistency

## Integration Points

The collaborative environment treats these as foundational services and builds on top of them rather than reimplementing
their functionality.

### Example Usage

```typescript
// Using infrastructure services
class CollaborativeNode {
  async initialize() {
    // Solana connection for state
    this.stateManager = new SolanaStateManager();
    
    // IPFS for content
    this.contentStore = new IPFSContentStore();
    
    // Holonet for networking
    this.network = new HolonetConnection();
  }

  async deployTool(tool: Tool) {
    // Store tool code on IPFS
    const cid = await this.contentStore.store(tool.code);
    
    // Register tool state on Solana
    const stateAccount = await this.stateManager.registerTool(tool.id, cid);
    
    // Advertise on Holonet
    await this.network.advertiseTool(tool.id, cid, stateAccount);
  }
}
```

## Performance Layer

### RTOS Foundation

- Real-time deterministic behavior
- Predictable performance
- Task scheduling
- Resource management

### Rust Implementation

- Zero-cost abstractions
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Predictable performance
- Direct hardware access when needed

The RTOS layer, implemented in Rust, provides:

```rust
// Example of low-level performance critical operations
pub struct RTOSLayer {
    scheduler: TaskScheduler,
    memory_pool: MemoryPool,
    io_manager: IOManager
}

impl RTOSLayer {
    // Direct hardware access when needed
    pub fn handle_critical_task(&mut self) -> Result<(), Error> {
        // Zero-cost abstraction over hardware
        self.scheduler.schedule_immediate(|| {
            // Real-time guarantees
        })
    }
}
```

## Note

While we leverage these technologies, the collaborative environment's architecture remains somewhat agnostic to them.
Different implementations could potentially use alternative technologies that provide similar capabilities. The
RTOS/Rust layer exists primarily for performance-critical operations while maintaining the system's overall flexibility.
