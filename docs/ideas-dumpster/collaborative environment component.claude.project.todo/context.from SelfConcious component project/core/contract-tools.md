# Contract Enforcement Tools

Path: `/docs/collaborative-environment/core/contract-tools.md`

## Market-Driven Contract Enforcement

Contract enforcement isn't rigid - it's handled by competing tools in the marketplace:

```graphql
# Tool advertisement in the market
type ContractTool {
  id: ID!
  capabilities: [ContractCapability!]!
  interpretationStyle: InterpretationMetrics!
  costModel: CostStructure!
  reputation: ReputationMetrics!
}

# What the tool is good at
type ContractCapability {
  contractTypes: [String!]!
  contextAwareness: Float!     # 0-1 how well it handles context
  flexibilityScore: Float!     # 0-1 how flexible in interpretation
  learningRate: Float!         # How quickly it adapts
}
```

## Fuzzy Contract Interpretation

Tools compete on how well they interpret and enforce fuzzy contract terms:

```typescript
interface ContractInterpreter {
  // Returns a weight 0-1 for how well action satisfies contract
  async interpretCompliance(
    action: Action,
    contract: Contract,
    context: Context
  ): Promise<{
    weight: number;
    confidence: number;
    reasoning: string[];
  }>;
}

// Different tools can interpret differently
class CommunityFirstInterpreter implements ContractInterpreter {
  async interpretCompliance({ action, contract, context }) {
    const localBenefit = this.assessLocalBenefit(action);
    const communityImpact = this.assessCommunityImpact(action);
    
    // Nonlinear weighting based on community health
    return {
      weight: this.calculateWeight(localBenefit, communityImpact),
      confidence: 0.85,
      reasoning: ["High local benefit", "Sustainable impact"]
    };
  }
}
```

## Composable Contracts

Contracts themselves can be composed and traded:

```typescript
interface ComposableContract {
  // Base contract terms
  terms: ContractTerms[];
  
  // How this contract can combine with others
  compositionRules: CompositionRule[];
  
  // How terms adapt to context
  adaptationPatterns: AdaptationPattern[];
}

// Example composition
const communityContract = {
  terms: [
    { type: "localRetention", minWeight: 0.7 },
    { type: "communityBenefit", minWeight: 0.6 }
  ],
  compositionRules: [
    { 
      canCombineWith: ["sustainabilityContract"],
      resolutionStrategy: "weightedAverage"
    }
  ],
  adaptationPatterns: [
    {
      condition: "economicHardship",
      adjustment: { localRetention: "+0.1" }
    }
  ]
};
```

## Market Dynamics

Tools compete based on:

- Interpretation accuracy
- Context awareness
- Learning capability
- Cost efficiency
- Community satisfaction

```typescript
interface MarketMetrics {
  // How well tool predictions match community expectations
  interpretationAccuracy: number;
  
  // How quickly tool adapts to new situations
  adaptationSpeed: number;
  
  // Community satisfaction with enforcement
  satisfactionScore: number;
  
  // Cost effectiveness
  costPerInterpretation: number;
}
```

## Feedback Loops

Tools learn and adapt through:

- Community feedback
- Outcome tracking
- Peer comparison
- Market signals

```typescript
class AdaptiveEnforcer {
  async learn(outcome: Outcome) {
    // Update weights based on community feedback
    this.weights = this.adjustWeights(
      this.weights,
      outcome.communityFeedback
    );
    
    // Adapt interpretation patterns
    this.patterns = this.evolvePatterns(
      this.patterns,
      outcome.effectiveness
    );
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Tool Selection**
    - Match tool capabilities to needs
    - Consider cost/benefit tradeoffs
    - Monitor effectiveness
    - Be ready to switch tools

2. **Contract Design**
    - Keep terms flexible
    - Enable composition
    - Include adaptation rules
    - Consider context

3. **Feedback Integration**
    - Gather community input
    - Track outcomes
    - Measure effectiveness
    - Adjust as needed
