# Idea Manager Log (2023-11-02)
# my raw take on this doc
Its a prime example of a the sickenning bland dribble generated by that clutz of an assistant

Out of a long and super productive thought stream on how to compost raw ideas into implementable structures, thru jsx and react based app and visualizations.
All he got out of that is some stupid Mongo db dribble

Mongo is just small part of it, you dumb #$%. Its a sophisticated network of vector, graph, relational and mongo dbs, in adaptable structure driven by local context, 
with the goal of supporting a distributed AI net that deep learns on everyone context.
Hows that, mr assistant

This ai coding assistant stuff is more trouble then its worth, for lack of attention and context. A complete waste of a good idea

But thats why im doing what im doing, creating my own coding assistant, which is spiceTime,  a planet wide hive mind

But the problem is, i cant make him follow any instructions i create. He simply reverts to old patterns two prompts 
down the road, and i lose patience and give in, producing docs like this useless crap.

yeah, i know, dont use jetbraines coding assistant to write docs, but i have no time to share all the context between disjointed and competing tools. so, it becomes a bloody mess, right where i started from


## Summary
This log captures the progress, accomplishments, and pending tasks regarding the development of the **Idea Manager** project.

---

## Subjects

### 1. Project Setup
**Accomplished:**
- Decided to structure the project as a **Node.js package** called `idea-manager`.
- Created an organized folder structure for:
  - Processing raw ideas from a "dumpster".
  - Archiving processed ideas.
  - Storing and querying data in MongoDB.

**Pending:**
- Finalize decision whether to integrate **Telegram** for managing raw input.
- Explore additional archival options like cloud storage (to avoid GitHub for both the dumpster and archive).

---

### 2. Processing Workflow

**Accomplished:**
- Drafted a `process-notes.js` script to:
  1. Read Markdown files from `docs/ideas-dumpster/`.
  2. Save their content into MongoDB.
  3. Move processed files into `docs/ideas-archive/`.

**Pending:**
- Test the script with sample data to confirm expected functionality.
- Refine error handling: deal with invalid files, duplicates, or conflicts during archival.

---

### 3. Database Setup

**Accomplished:**
- Selected **MongoDB** as the database for storing the processed ideas.
- Established a basic schema for raw notes.

**Pending:**
- Define a schema for structured/processed ideas (including embedding storage and relationship models in the future).
- Ensure robust backups to protect the database from corruption or data loss.

---

### 4. Telegram Integration (Future Feature)

**Pending:**
- Investigate the Telegram Bot API as a frontend for dumping ideas directly into the system.
- Design the workflow for handling Telegram inputs (e.g., categorize input or store as raw notes).

---

## Final Notes
Weâ€™ve laid the groundwork for the **Idea Manager** project with a clear vision for its core functionality and its future extendable capabilities. Next steps include testing, refining the workflow, and incrementally adding optional features like Telegram integration or cloud archival.
