# **DiAICodeAssistant Configuration Documentation**

This document details the configuration management strategy for DiAICodeAssistant. The system utilizes transient
configuration files that dynamically adapt to individual environments while maintaining a clean and consistent
development experience for all contributors.

---

## **Key Configuration Principles**

1. **Transience Over Permanence**:
    - Configuration files are **transient**, meaning they are generated and initialized dynamically during setup.
    - No transient configuration files are pushed to version control (*e.g., no `.git` pollution from
      environment-specific settings*).

2. **Clean Initialization**:
    - On first use, the system initializes into a **clean state** using **templated configuration files** as a baseline.
    - Developers can rely on a predictable setup process without requiring personal settings to be backed up.

3. **Modularity and Flexibility**:
    - Configuration is modular, allowing team members to override settings locally based on their role or environment (
      e.g., developer, QA, or staging settings).

4. **Role-Specific Configuration**:
    - Different roles may require templated configs designed for their specific needs (e.g., backend developers vs.
      designers).
    - Templates ensure consistency across roles while preventing unnecessary coupling.

---

## **How It Works: Transient Config Files**

### **1. Templated Configuration**

Templated configuration files serve as the foundation for initializing the DiAICodeAssistant:

- Templates are stored in the `/config/templates/` directory within the repository.
- Example configuration templates:
    - `development-template.json`
    - `staging-template.json`
    - `production-template.json`
- These files define default settings such as:
    - API endpoints
    - Authentication strategies
    - Project paths
    - Logging and debug flags

When developers set up the application, these templates are copied and adapted to **transient configuration files**
tailored to their local environment.

### **2. Transient Configuration Files**

Transient files are local, dynamically generated files (e.g., during the `init` phase). These files live in a designated
folder (e.g., `/config/local/`) and are ignored by `.gitignore`.

Example:

- A local transient file could be `config/local/development.json`.
- Transient files are lightweight and available only within individual developer environments.

### **3. Regeneration and Reset**

Since transient files are generated automatically:

- The system can **regenerate transient configs** whenever needed by referencing the original templates.
- A simple `reset` operation returns the environment to a **clean state** without impacting local customizations.

---

## **Configuration Folder Structure**

The repository organizes configurations as follows:

```plaintext
/config/
├── templates/
│   ├── development-template.json
│   ├── staging-template.json
│   ├── production-template.json
│   └── global-template.json
├── local/
│   ├── development.json (auto-generated; .gitignored)
│   ├── staging.json (auto-generated; .gitignored)
├── global-config.json (team-shared, versioned)
└── README.md (this documentation)
```

### **Explanation**:

1. **`/templates/`**:
    - Contains reference configuration templates for initialization.
    - Templates define standard baselines that apply universally.
    - These files are version-controlled to ensure consistency across the team.

2. **`/local/`**:
    - Auto-generated transient configs based on templates.
    - Excluded from version control (`.gitignore`).
    - Specific to individual environments due to local paths, secrets, or developer preferences.

3. **`global-config.json`**:
    - Defines shared configurations for the system.
    - Contains values like feature flags, global toggles, or team-wide variables.
    - Version-controlled for team collaboration.

## **Setup and Configuration Workflow**

### **1. Initialization**

When the system is first installed (`init` command), it:

1. Prompts the user for environment-specific settings (if any).
2. Generates transient configuration files in `/config/local/` by merging:
    - Template configurations found in `/config/templates/`.
    - Custom inputs provided during initialization.

Example:

```bash
$ ./DiAICodeAssistant init
✔ Select environment: development
✔ Enter API endpoint: https://dev-api.example.com
✔ Set debug mode: true
Configuration initialized for 'development' environment.
```

A file like `config/local/development.json` is created automatically.

---

### **2. Local Development**

Developers can customize their transient configurations as needed:

- Path: `config/local/development.json`
- Changes apply **locally only** and do not impact repository integrity.

For example:

```json
{
  "apiEndpoint": "https://dev-api.example.com",
  "debug": true,
  "authToken": "personal-access-token"
}
```

These changes are scoped to the developer’s needs and excluded from version control.

---

### **3. Resetting Configuration**

At any point, users can reset their environment:

1. Delete the `config/local/` directory.
2. Re-run the `init` command to regenerate transient files from templates.

This ensures a clean setup without manual intervention.

---

## **Best Practices**

1. **Never Push Local Configurations**:
    - Ensure transient configuration files in `config/local/` are excluded via `.gitignore`.
    - Any team-shared variables should reside in version-controlled files (like `global-config.json` or `/templates/`).

2. **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets**:
    - Use environment variables for sensitive values (e.g., API keys, database credentials).
    - Integrate `.env` file support or similar tools.

3. **Keep Templates Minimal Yet Fundamental**:
    - Include only baseline configurations in templates.
    - Avoid role-specific settings unless universally necessary.

4. **Use `global-config.json` for Shared Logic**:
    - Shared logic, like feature flags or project-wide paths, should be versioned for consistency.
    - Transient files should not depend on other local configurations to avoid cascading mismatches.

---

## **Example Workflow**

1. Developer clones the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/example/DiAICodeAssistant.git
   cd DiAICodeAssistant
   ```

2. Runs the initialization process:
   ```bash
   ./DiAICodeAssistant init
   ✔ Environment: development
   ✔ API URL: https://localhost:4000
   ✔ Generate config files...
   ✔ Done!
   ```

3. Works locally with `config/local/development.json`:
    - Updates debug flags or testing preferences if needed.

4. Resets to a clean stage when required:
   ```bash
   ./DiAICodeAssistant reset
   ✔ Deleted local configs.
   ✔ Reinitialized from templates.
   ```

5. Commits team-wide changes:
    - Updates shared templates in `/config/templates/` or `global-config.json`, ensuring no transient files are
      accidentally added.

## **Roadmap for Configuration Management**

Future enhancements:

1. **Cloud-Based Shared Configs**:
    - Store global-state logic in a shared cloud database for better real-time collaboration.

2. **Dynamic Overrides**:
    - Allow agents to dynamically update transient configs during runtime for debugging or testing.

3. **Visual Configuration Tool**:
    - Build a tool that allows developers to tweak configs via GUI, removing manual JSON edits.

This structure keeps the **DiAICodeAssistant** configuration clean, agile, and optimized for collaborative development.
