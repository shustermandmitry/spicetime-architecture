we have to develope the seed proto of spicetime
Its a style sheet defining the props of spicetime
its in smart contract, and cascades thru the space of spicetime
We have to find the props that will will nail the technical and social aspects solid and cosize in orthogonal way
meaning the most minimum set of props that do not interact
it can be ideas, sentances, not just a single short name
and every STComponent will have this STSeed as proto
So,its a STComponent, a react component, but it has to live in text on blockchain
SO, its a pure function that just spits out an onject
Unless smart contractys are functions, and i think they are
So, then its a progenitor function that managers multiple aspects, a bag of functions, a function that spits out a bag of functions
And it takes no args, for its the progenitor, it has no deps and is consistent thru any environment

So, a style sheet, a component, whats the difference, but we have to settle down on lingo so folks dontb get confused
