# Process Editor: A Component-Based Universal Interface

## Introduction

This document describes a revolutionary approach to software design where everything is a component, including time
itself. At its core is a visual editor that treats processes as composable components, enabling a unified interface for
designing systems across any domain.

## Core Concepts

### The Component Universe

- Everything is a React component
- Components contain other components
- Every tool is itself a component
- Every domain is a collection of components
- The editor itself is just another component

### Time as a Component

- Clock component manages state transitions
- Each domain has its own time patterns
- Components evolve through structured states
- History constrains possible transitions
- Time itself has templates (process patterns)

### Domains

- Web Development
- Biology
- Manufacturing
- Each with its own:
    - Life stages
    - State transitions
    - Composition rules
    - Time patterns

## The Process Editor

### Purpose

- Visual design of process components
- Extension of base Process component
- Unified interface for all domains
- Seamless switching between visual and code views

### Core Components

#### Process Component

- Base component for all processes
- Defines state machine structure
- Handles time management
- Manages transitions and constraints

#### Branch Component

- Handles decision points
- Controls flow direction
- Manages conditional transitions
- Preserves process history

#### State Component

- Represents process stages
- Contains stage-specific logic
- Manages entry/exit conditions
- Tracks state duration

### Views

#### Visual Editor

- Drag-and-drop interface
- Visual process flow
- Component connections
- Real-time preview

#### Code View

- Functional component representation
- State machine definition
- Transition logic
- Time management code

### Properties Panel

- Component configuration
- State definitions
- Transition rules
- Time constraints

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure

```javascript
const Process = {
  initial: State,
  states: {
    [stateName]: {
      on: {
        [event]: nextState
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Time Management

```javascript
const Clock = {
  domain: Domain,
  state: State,
  history: History,
  transitions: {
    allowed: [],
    forbidden: []
  }
}
```

### Domain Integration

```javascript
const Domain = {
  components: Components,
  timePattern: Pattern,
  states: States,
  rules: Rules
}
```

## Use Cases

### Web Development

- Component lifecycle management
- Build process orchestration
- Deployment workflows
- State management

### Manufacturing

- Production line management
- Quality control processes
- Supply chain optimization
- Resource allocation

### Biology

- Growth process modeling
- Evolution simulation
- Lifecycle management
- Environmental interaction

## Future Directions

### AI Integration

- Process pattern learning
- Automated optimization
- Predictive state management
- Smart transitions

### Cross-Domain Composition

- Process pattern sharing
- Domain interface creation
- Universal state machines
- Time synchronization

### Visual Language Evolution

- Domain-specific notations
- Universal process symbols
- Time visualization
- State representation

## Technical Requirements

### Core Technologies

- React
- State Machine Framework
- Time Management System
- Visual Editor Framework

### Development Environment

- Component Development Kit
- Process Testing Tools
- Time Simulation Tools
- Domain Modeling Kit

## Getting Started

### Basic Process Creation

1. Choose domain
2. Define states
3. Add branches
4. Configure transitions
5. Test process flow

### Advanced Features

- Custom time patterns
- Cross-domain processes
- State machine optimization
- History management

## Best Practices

### Process Design

- Start simple
- Build incrementally
- Test transitions
- Document constraints

### Component Architecture

- Keep components pure
- Manage state carefully
- Handle time explicitly
- Document patterns

### Time Management

- Respect domain patterns
- Track state history
- Handle conflicts
- Maintain consistency

## Conclusion

The Process Editor represents a fundamental shift in how we think about software design. By treating everything as
components and incorporating time as a first-class citizen, we create a universal interface for designing and managing
processes across all domains.
