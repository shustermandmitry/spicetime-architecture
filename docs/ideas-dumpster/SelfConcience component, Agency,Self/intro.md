# Context

## Personal agency

Agency and awareness comes from a predefined goal of evolution of a process
such as a human trying to improve its standing by learning new ways to cope, like getting an education
Thats agency, taking care of ones needs
How and why its done is cultural

## Culture

Culture is not something applicable to an individual
Its an emergent phenomena, a quantum state of society the individual belongs to
And mems of culture are circulating like so many ghosts, creating a field, measurable by judging a community member.

By what? That depends on the judge, the observer

## Culture wave function

And what does he measure?
The amount of each mem in guys head.
Yes, its a quantum measurement, collapsing community wave function, composed of mem states, in a linear superposition,
to a personal character of one of its members, judged/performed from perspective of someone else

So, what exactly our SelfConcience component supposed to do? It cant send the guy thru college, or preach good manners
on sundays, right?
Well, first of all, lets define the goals, once we have a victim to apply it to.Thats the bguy we talking about, thats
his node component, and it operates on him, so im not joking.

This is the component that makes that guy get concious, of community goal;s and values, and not existing values, for
that would not change anything, but establish and maintain a status quo.
The real trick is to guide him towards community desired cultural goals, represented by a specific measuremnt of a wave
function, not at present time, but in the future
How distant future?
Well, its not a one step process, to evolve community culture, but a process, with a wave function evolution
And what describes such evolution? I think thats the SHroudenger equation.
And whats the Hamiltonian thats evolving?
Thats the operator that produces community energy distribution thru time and community space
ANd what is that space?
Thats the culture, the ethical space. and we can use that to predict an individual position and momentum and more
measurables in that space.
Basically, we can calculate how culture will evolve, by knowing the shape of a wave function at a moment in time,
distributed in community physical space,
which is the graph of its members connected by relational edges
these edges and netwok of local connections is community space, and its fllat if all connections are local, and curved
if there non local connections, when deals are made in smoke filled rooms with other unethical smokers, bypassing the
local simpole folks
it shifts the flow of resources and information, which is the energy flux, and you get what happens. curvature of space
that create masses, personal wealth accumulation.

So, why all that is relevant to the price of gold watch that guy is selling?
Cos hes gonna pay taxes on that sale, to the community fund
amount of tax is determined by community needs at the moment and by looking ahead a bit, thats where that wave function
evolution calculations help. And running a bit ahead, those cultural calculations predict distribution of matter,
wealth, thru community.
How, by quantum gravity calculations. Thats where we heading. You see, wave function evolution translates to mass
distribution, which is the geometry of space, and we just tracked how qm and gr are unoited !!!! Not a small feat, but
not that hard to see.

ok, so taxes. What are those, cos qm and gr are not spoken in tax forms lingo, right?
Thats the Hamiltonian that shapes the evolution of the wave function.
So, now we have a way to shape, precisely, the evolution of community/org culture, and predict its wealth, which is its
overhead, and its distribution, which is budget allocation, and to optimize wealth and to minimize it. Yep, you got it
right, the goal is not to get bvrich, but to optimize in the scope of a greater community, so we dont get monopolies
that take the last cake off the plate.
And thats all done by that SelfConcieos component in that guy head.
and we gonna design it.
And the mechanics are covered in other docs and that has to do with calculating the guys position in ethical space
io thought very long and hard what is that ethical space is equavalent to in physics, for we have to know to do
calculations.
Its not like physical space for its has a limited volume and a distinct special point of origin. it has no symmetries of
a physical space,but its related, for it generates that ethical score at each point in space, at each node.
and each node of space has a position in it. Its a vector field, i guess. each node has a three value position, but not
spatial positions, but of some field.
But it generates a scalar field of ethical score and that field is def a potential field and creates a hamiltonian we
use in that shroedenger equation i covered above.
so, we got a hamiltonian that drives cultural wave function we can use to predict evolution of culture thru space and
life cycle of an org, and we got it connected to geometry of space. Thats entirely new connection, not paralleled in
field theory. Thats why it felt so weird.
and i already developed a math transform that relates amplitudes of wave func to geometry thru a metric tensor. so,
thats the theory of quantum gravity

But in practical form, it allows us to compose a desired composition of org culture, in form of weights on each
component of culture, categorized along particles of standard theory, or some emergent props like viscosity and density
and whatever, ai will figure out statistical relationships,amnd map it on rules of taxations and budget allocations.

And more then that, not just watch the show but directly responding to trends and adjusting internal parameters to
adjust the feedback loops and control rate of change and its distribution thru space, to minimize suffering and to tread
carefully but steady, towards a better future.

And thats on every level, from a country to an org to an individual, a self concious structure, intellegent and
purposeful at each level, united in its purpose, whatever its doing, but always guided by highest ethical law, the top
dog smart contract. Perhaps well make it ten commendments, or something else for middle east, or communist manifesto for
the russians
