# Abstract

Concious is about purpose, a guiding hand to evolve to a goal, representing agency, purposeful evolution, not just
survival

Thats why animals are not self concious, they use the basic native evolution selection mechanism, not soumething they
posses internally, like a sense of purpose, which is a sense of self

So, goals can be selfish and community oriented
Wjhen an ai agent like HiveMind becomes self evolving, we have to ask whats the goal of that evolution.
The answer should be to help communities, in any way the need help, including making himself more efficient, and having
more time to help
humans, away from self introspection of deep learning and doing chores

And how will it know what human needs really are?
It can ask, and get stupid answers like I dont know, or non of your business, or i need more money.
But it might be good to ask at times, for sure, for ai is smart enough to filter out the idiots. Still, it does not need
to be intrusive like that.

Then, it can encourage people to record thjeir experiences so it has guidence what the issues are, from human
perspective
Thats better but it should help, not nag

The best approach is to do what every human should do, record a trail of Guides and Tutorials on every problem and every
solution in their journey, but then noone will ever finish anything, for its a recursive call that never comes
back.Maybe not the first few guides, but sure enough, on the third one, the charm one, all the way down the stack, of
charms, chiming to a tangent.
So, ai is much better at recursion, and it should just do it for us. It has the context thru helping you, and it can
record those guides and tutorials based on YOUR experience.

And that will be the guide another agent of evolution, an angel of SelfConcience, will swoop and read thru the wisdom of
the complain department, and solve common issiues, with a few well placed automation scripts.

And thats folks, pretty much one of the major modes of its operation.
of course, not the only one, for its composable
And we just described a child component of SelfConcious called HumanPerspective

So heres the convo with Kostya

Note my drift on forming the culture of mentorship and experience sharing
So, if an ai does it in the background, its not helping shaping human behaviour
So, as always, its an interactive process. AI might pop into view and chime a suggestion to do a tutorial, or the dev
can instruct ai, and they spend a minute or two reflecting on the subject and what and how present it to the team.
No one wants to be trailed by a box of nuts and bolts recording every blunder in an awkward alien way.

# Metrics of success

One comes to mind

Number of dead end tangents in aggregated total of the team, and each dev
These guides record the direction, with all the pains of creation and meanderings around dead alleys and murky byways
And these is subject of public scrutiny now, and ai can raise red flags to other members of the team, informing them
that one guy is spending his time on some isoteric quantum gravity research,
and have not even finished testing the last package he created weeks ago.
And the intervention pussy forms, and the guys head gets adjusted by his agent gently nudging to leave it for later.

For we dont wanna get derated in respect metric of ethical score, by the EthicsManager component of SelfConscience ilk.
