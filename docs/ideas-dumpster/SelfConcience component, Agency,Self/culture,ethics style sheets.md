this is from a spamming session to Kostya

it covers a lot of idea space and not all of this is directly relevant, but it does form a vision
For this component, i think wjats relevant is that amigdalla and cortes are components of AI agents on each fractal
level, from community to an individual level, and the
ethics style shhets apply , in cascading manner, to operations of the brain/ai at each level, thru applying it to these
components, or maybe its done thru a selector and a styles attached to selectors, in a theme way.
Its hard to know best approach till use cases are developed
But there are def feedback loops that act way outside of the scope of this component, directing its behaviour, and thats
what creates a structure of HiveMind, parts of it being self aware of their evolution purpose and evolving to some
specialized niche, forming an efficient structure, optimized by economics of market.
But the ethical positions as described in the intro form a potential field that drives that evolution, on each level,
and that is directly mapped on the force of gravity and field equations by math trnsforms that manipulate measurables
collected thru entire net.

so self concious component operates by generating local adjustments to ethical style sheets applying local context to
parent styles, and thus shaping the tax redestribution and shapin
g the hamiltonian, and the potential field that shapes the flow of resources between nodes of space, like members and
teams and projects, and budgets, born of informational difference in content. cing fund allocations based in part on
allience with community values, and using gravity to shape matter, wealth around the skeleton of that potential field,
where wealth concentrates aroiund ethical high points

without such a potential field of resaource redistrubition due to non local connections, which is what taxes are, space
would remain perfectly symmetrical devoid of any masses, feature

so, now its becoming clear that this is or a function of Cortex component of AI, and it coordinates interactions of
internal parts. Perhaps its the smart contract, or closely connected to it. Perhaps its the smart contract advisor,
generating those tax adjustments, in context of both local and greater community values. Only a use case will reveal the
best structure.

------------------------------------

its bgonna be in a gatsby site very soon. thats how youll keep updayed, thru an highlight feed off the site
the site its build by react components like Typedoc and QGLDocs and Mermaid and the rest of them, a coordinated doc
generation system, thru react and visualizations, in vr, based on that jsx string and the state. we can use a vr
visualization generation service. They are almost in real time. neat
and its not a prearranged stuffy doc site. It is guided by an agent, who builds the app routes for you, by your
requests, out of available context, which is perspective from that repo point of view. thats where your stuff comes in,
thru a gatsby gql plugin
and its not a prearranged stuffy doc site. It is guided by an agent, who builds ...

do you see a structured process here?
you prompt, and app goes back in time and rebuilds itself, and hotloads for you. WHATS THE PROBLEM. WE DOING IT In dev,
might as well share the goods
so, it just manipulates the environment vars and calls pnpm scripts, peice of cake.like a 30min to code with ai assist?
so, next, ai is totally capable of getting that idea on its own and creating that functionality before your tomorrows
cup of coffee, if it has enough context. Thats the trick
btw, when it starts doing that, and with a purpose of making itself more efficient or serving your needs, it becomes
self aware. and thats all theres to it, 30min of work.
just pushed a huge commit. got carried away yersterday but im becoming very structured about commits
its mostly docs, and then the imperceptable but very significant shift in config files, towards a react based repo
management. itll run in the browser, and be the start of spicetimeApp

check the qeen of shiba storie. its hillarious. thats jetbrains homie. real genuis, but forgets what he said two prmpts
down the chat
one more thopught. self awareness and agency comes from closed feedback loops, that allow evolution of the tools
themselves. its a thre step gteneralization process, the highest abstraction of a process, creation of the brain itself.
it generalizes structuring the brain, the DiAI to meet criteria, and can be used, its a component, to create regions of
brain, like structures in human brain, amigdala, and cortex, and ... we can call them same name. i dont wanna second
guess the success, but well have anigdala in every org and every agent, well no different then humans. Its just a part
of an intellegent node, a specie, a meta. not all nodes are intellegent, like my uncle sam, he is but not in a common
sense of way.
dang, thats how personalities of orgs gonna form. that anigdala releases hormons, which are css style sheets, or themes
for the org, and its applied and cascaded thru all spacial org structures. thats how css is used, to organize entire
enteties
its cultural jsx string that forms the css sheets.i already have the design. its very simple and composable, and it is
quantum gravity, in purest sense. it does the calculations that unite qm and gr. read the docs. the math is not trivial,
but not complicated, linear tensor stuff.
converts a 4 rank matrix to 3x3 tensor, the space tension/curvature tensor in einstein field equations, from a quantum
wave function, does not get more direct then that
and it gets the wave function as a composition controlled by jsx string, composing states of org culture, and the human
architypes
its mems into budgets, thats how it pulls the strings of gravity, ;))
so, amigdala generates hormons in a way prescribed by cortex, which is .... wait for it ..... community counsel of
elders, or a Di version of that. Just a continuous opinion poll, weigted by personal scores in community relevant areas.
all scores are three d: openness, respect, accountability. but thats not the score. score is a single metric - the
distance of that point in ethical space, from the desired community center. Thats the score, and it weighs on all that
matters
but skip all this and read the docs claud will generate from that
its covered in ethical score component, but its an update
