# Configuration Universe: Distributed Architecture Roadmap

## Core Challenges

### 1. Object Penetration

- Objects have different penetration levels across layers
- Some are completely opaque (security boundaries)
- Some are semi-transparent (filtered data)
- Some are fully transparent (public services)

```typescript
interface ObjectBoundary {
  // How object interacts with layers
  penetration: {
    opaque: Layer[]      // Can't pass through
    filtered: Layer[]    // Passes with transformation
    transparent: Layer[] // Passes freely
  },
  
  // How to handle boundaries
  crossing: {
    allowed: CrossingRule[]
    blocked: CrossingRule[]
    transform: Transform[]
  }
}
```

### 2. Distance and Topology

```typescript
interface SpaceMetrics {
  // Physical distance
  network: {
    latency: number
    bandwidth: number
    reliability: number
  },
  
  // Logical distance
  service: {
    hops: number         // Services between
    transforms: number   // Necessary transformations
    cost: number        // Resource usage
  }
}
```

### 3. Object Shadows

- Services/objects can cast "shadows"
- Shadows affect visibility and access
- Need to map shadow geometries
- Handle shadow overlaps

```typescript
interface Shadow {
  // What casts shadow
  source: ServiceObject,
  
  // Shadow properties
  properties: {
    opacity: number     // How much blocks
    falloff: number     // How fast fades
    spectrum: string[]  // What it blocks
  },
  
  // Affected areas
  coverage: {
    services: Service[]
    paths: Path[]
    objects: Object[]
  }
}
```

### 4. Service Illumination

- Services "shine" their capabilities
- Light has different wavelengths (features)
- Light can be blocked or transformed
- Need to calculate illumination patterns

```typescript
interface ServiceLight {
  // Light properties
  spectrum: {
    features: Feature[]
    strength: number
    reach: number
  },
  
  // How it travels
  propagation: {
    direct: Path[]
    reflected: Path[]
    scattered: Path[]
  }
}
```

  topology: {
    services: Position[]
    boundaries: Boundary[]
    paths: Path[]
  },
  
  // Calculate metrics
  metrics: {
    distance(a: Position, b: Position): number
    path(a: Position, b: Position): Path[]
    cost(path: Path): number
  }
}
```

### 2. Message Physics

```typescript
interface MessagePhysics {
  // How messages travel
  propagation: {
    speed: number
    decay: number
    splitting: boolean
  },
  
  // How they interact
  interaction: {
    reflection: Rule[]
    refraction: Rule[]
    absorption: Rule[]
  }
}
```

### 3. Boundary Analysis

```typescript
interface BoundarySystem {
  // Boundary properties
  boundaries: {
    type: BoundaryType
    permeability: number
    transformations: Transform[]
  },
  
  // Crossing mechanics
  crossing: {
    rules: CrossingRule[]
    costs: CrossingCost[]
    effects: CrossingEffect[]
  }
}
```
