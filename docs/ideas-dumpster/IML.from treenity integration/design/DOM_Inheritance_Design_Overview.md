# DOM Inheritance Design

## Overview

The DOM inheritance system in IML ensures a structured flow of attributes and content across hierarchical sections of a
document. By utilizing cascading rules, IML minimizes redundant tagging while maintaining flexibility, enabling clean
and maintainable document authoring.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Attribute Cascading**

Attributes defined at higher levels of the document hierarchy are inherited by nested sections, reducing the need for
repetitive tagging.

**Example:**

```plaintext
$title: Software Design
$add: Best Practices
--to=Principles
```

Generated Structure:

- The `$add` attribute is automatically applied to all descendant sections under `Principles`.

---

### 2. **Scope Resolution**

Each attribute is scoped to a specific section of the document tree:

- Global attributes (`$title`, `$action`) are applied project-wide.
- Scoped attributes (`$add`, `$append`) are restricted based on their target nodes.

**Example of Scoping:**

```plaintext
$add: Scalability
--to=Principles

// Content under "Principles" inherits $add
```

---

### 3. **Attribute Overrides**

Child nodes can override inherited attributes, ensuring higher levels of control.

**Example:**

```plaintext
$title: Distributed Systems
Principles of distributed systems.

$add: Fault Tolerance
--to=Techniques

// Child nodes override $add
$add: High Availability
--to=Techniques
```

Rendered Result:

```plaintext
Techniques:
- Fault Tolerance
- High Availability
```

## Inheritance Mechanics

### 1. **Attribute Propagation Algorithm**

The propagation engine traverses the document tree:

- **Top-Down Cascade**: Attributes are propagated from parent to children sections.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Child-specific attributes take precedence over parents.

**Algorithm:**

1. Traverse the document tree starting from the root.
2. At each node:
    - Collect parent attributes.
    - Apply child-specific overrides.
3. Generate a final resolved attribute set for each node.

---

### 2. **Dynamic Updates**

Leveraging React, updates to attributes trigger re-calculations and partial DOM updates:

- **Performance Optimization**: Only affected sections are re-rendered.
- **Consistency**: Changes propagate across all dependent sections in real time.

---

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Global Attribute Cascade

```plaintext
$title: Distributed Systems
$add: Scalability
--to=Principles
```

- **Output:**
    - **Title**: "Distributed Systems"
    - **Principles**: "Scalability" is automatically added to all its nested sections.

---

### Example 2: Local Overrides

```plaintext
$title: System Design
$add: Scalability
--to=Optimization

$add: Performance Tuning
--to=Optimization
```

- **Output:**
    - **Optimization**: Includes both "Scalability" and "Performance Tuning".

---

## Benefits of DOM Inheritance

1. **Simplifies Authoring**: Less repetition when dealing with hierarchical content.
2. **Improves Flexibility**: Overrides allow for edge-case-specific content modifications.
3. **Optimized Performance**: Efficient attribute resolution ensures minimal re-renders.
4. **Scalable Design**: Handles complex documentation structures with ease.

---

## Edge Cases

### Attribute Conflicts

Conflicting attributes within overlapping scopes are resolved by:

- Applying child-defined attributes.
- Logging warnings for potential redundancies.

### Circular Dependencies

IML avoids circular dependencies by enforcing a single inheritance chain for attributes. Attempting to link sections
back to their parent will result in an error.

**Error Example:**

```plaintext
$add: Fault Tolerance
--to=Techniques

$add: Techniques
--to=Fault Tolerance

// Error: Circular Dependency Detected
```
