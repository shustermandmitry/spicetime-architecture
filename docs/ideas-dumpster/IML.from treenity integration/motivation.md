# Motivation Behind IML

## The Challenge

Developers often face a significant challenge in managing and maintaining large-scale evolving documentation:

- **Unstructured Content**: Initial drafts are often scattered and lack cohesion.
- **Complex Hierarchies**: Manual structuring of large documentation systems quickly becomes unsustainable.
- **Repetitive Updates**: Adding related content or tracking tasks in specific sections leads to redundant effort.

Furthermore, integrating actionable insights (like sending notifications, creating tasks, etc.) within documents usually
requires external tooling, which increases cognitive load.

## The Solution

IML is crafted to handle the pain points above by automating, structuring, and rendering documents dynamically. Its
unique features include:

- **Incremental Refinement**: Start with raw, unstructured content and incrementally improve it through minimal tagging.
- **Attribute Inheritance**: Cascading attributes simplify hierarchies, reducing redundant tags and updates.
- **Actionable Documents**: Allow embedding proposed actions directly into content sections (`$action` tags) with
  flexible side-effects.
- **Live Feedback**: React integration ensures all changes dynamically reflect in real-time.

## Why Choose IML?

IML empowers teams with:

1. **Efficiency**: Automate structuring and actionable workflows to focus on content creation.
2. **Transparency**: Tasks, actions, and notes live alongside the document, requiring no external context.
3. **Scalability**: Handle growing complexity in documentation with IMLâ€™s hierarchical inheritance principles.
4. **Faster Iteration**: The live preview system (powered by React) speeds up adjustments with hot reloads.

## Practical Applications

IML can be applied in various real-world scenarios:

- **Project Documentation**: Structure, refine, and automate tasks associated with technical documentation.
- **Actionable Briefs**: Create outlines that not only inform decisions but also track actions for teams.
- **Support Knowledge Bases**: Dynamically evolving documents for technical/customer support teams driven by updates.

IML is the next step in making documentation not just passive, but active and actionable!
