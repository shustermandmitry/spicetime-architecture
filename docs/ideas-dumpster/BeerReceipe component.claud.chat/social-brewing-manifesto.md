# The Social Brewer's Manifesto

## A Theory of Communal Brewing Economics

### Core Principles

1. Fair Exchange Value

- Beer is valued at production cost
- $1/bottle covers materials
- No profit from friends
- Quality without markup

2. Distribution Theory
   For each 5-gallon batch (48-50 bottles):

- 20 bottles: Cost recovery ($1 each)
- 15 bottles: Personal stock
- 15 bottles: Community share
    * Trading stock
    * Sharing events
    * New brewer education
    * Community building

- One batch for current drinking
- One batch developing
- Knowledge freely shared
- Equipment communally maintained

### Conclusion

The Social Brewer creates not just beer, but community. Through fair exchange, shared knowledge, and collective
resources, we build a sustainable brewing culture that enriches all participants. The true value is not in the beer
itself, but in the connections it creates and the community it builds.

Beer is a means, not an end - a tool for building community, sharing knowledge, and creating collective value. When we
brew with this understanding, we create something far more valuable than what we can bottle.

Remember: Good beer is shared beer, fairly made and freely given.
