# Detailed Malting Guide for 5-Gallon Beer Batch

## Initial Requirements

### Grain Quantity

- Need 12 lbs finished malt for 5-gallon batch
- Start with 15 lbs raw barley (accounts for loss)

### Space Requirements

- Grain bed depth: 2-3 inches maximum
- Area needed: 8 sq ft (4' x 2' minimum)
- Container suggestions:
    * Large plastic storage tub
    * Multiple shallow trays
    * DIY malting box with raised mesh bottom
      a test
## Equipment Setup

### Air Circulation

- 2x 120mm PC fans minimum
- Position for even airflow across grain bed
- Fans should run 24/7 during germination
- Speed control recommended
- Mount 12-18 inches above grain bed

### Temperature Control

- Small space heater with thermostat
- Or heat lamp for smaller setups
- DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor
- Keep ambient temp 15-21°C (59-70°F)

### Moisture Control

- Spray bottle (clean, sanitized)
- Or ultrasonic humidifier
- Humidity target: 85-95%
- Moisture meter (if available)

## Detailed Process

### 1. STEEPING (48 hours)

```
Equipment: Large food-grade bucket or container

Day 1:
6:00 AM: First Steep
- Fill bucket with 65°F water (2:1 water to grain ratio)
- Submerge all grain
- Run aquarium air pump for oxygenation

2:00 PM: First Air Rest
- Drain completely
- Spread grain 2-3 inches deep
- Run fans on low

10:00 PM: Second Steep
- Repeat water soak
- Continue aeration

Day 2: Repeat cycle
- 6:00 AM: Air rest
- 2:00 PM: Final steep
- 10:00 PM: Final drain
```

### 2. GERMINATION (4-5 days)

```
Initial Setup:
- Spread grain evenly (2-3 inch depth)
- Level surface with clean rake or hands
- Position temperature sensor
- Start fans on medium speed

Daily Schedule:
Morning (8:00 AM):
- Turn grain gently with clean hands
- Check temperature
- Mist if needed (should feel moist, not wet)
- Look for mold or off-odors

Afternoon (2:00 PM):
- Turn grain again
- Mist if necessary
- Check acrospire growth
- Monitor temperature

Evening (8:00 PM):
- Final daily turn
- Adjust moisture
- Check temperature
- Clean any fallen roots
```

### 3. KILNING (24-36 hours)

```
Stage 1: Free Drying (12-16 hours)
- Temperature: 50°C (122°F)
- Maximum fan speed
- Turn grain every 4 hours
- Target moisture: below 10%

Stage 2: Protein Rest (2-3 hours)
- Raise temp to 70°C (158°F)
- Maintain fan speed
- Turn once halfway through

Stage 3: Final Cure (4-6 hours)
- Temperature: 80-85°C (176-185°F)
- Reduce fan speed
- No turning needed
- Final moisture: 3-5%
```

## Grain Bed Management

### Spreading Technique

1. Use clean, sanitized surface
2. Establish grid pattern:
    - Mark 1ft squares on base
    - Helps ensure even depth
3. Spread grain methodically:
    - Use clean rake or hands
    - Work in sections
    - Level with straight edge

### Turning Method

1. Lift and fold method:
    - Like turning compost
    - Gentle, don't crush grain
2. Pattern turning:
    - Start at one end
    - Work systematically
    - Ensure complete turn

### Moisture Management

1. Visual checks:
    - Grain should stick together when squeezed
    - Should break apart when released
2. Misting technique:
    - Use fine spray
    - 6-8 inches above grain
    - Even coverage
3. Frequency:
    - Check every 8 hours
    - Mist as needed
    - More in dry conditions

## Quality Control Checks

### During Steeping

- Water temperature
- Drain completeness
- Aeration effectiveness
- Chit (root tip) emergence

### During Germination

1. Acrospire growth:
    - Check 10 grains daily
    - Target 3/4 kernel length
    - Even development

2. Moisture content:
    - Squeeze test
    - Visual inspection
    - Weight assessment

### During Kilning

1. Temperature steps:
    - Monitor with probe
    - Even heat distribution
    - Proper ramping

2. Moisture reduction:
    - Grain should be hard
    - Breaks cleanly
    - No soft centers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Uneven germination:
    - Improve turning frequency
    - Check temperature distribution
    - Adjust bed depth

2. Mold growth:
    - Improve air circulation
    - Reduce moisture
    - Check temperature

3. Poor modification:
    - Extend germination time
    - Adjust temperature
    - Check moisture levels

## Final Testing

1. Bite test:
    - Grain should be crisp
    - No hard centers
    - Even color inside

2. Moisture test:
    - Should be brittle
    - No soft spots
    - Clean break

3. Aroma:
    - Sweet, malty
    - No musty smells
    - No grass odors
