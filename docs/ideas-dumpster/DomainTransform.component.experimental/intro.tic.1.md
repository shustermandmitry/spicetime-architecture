# QM as Spicetime Mapping: An Experimental Approach

## The Idea

We're exploring QM as a possible tool for mapping between spicetime domains. This is experimental thinking, but it seems
promising because:

- It might help map complex domain structures
- It could preserve internal patterns
- It might generate useful results

## Initial Experiment: Core Process

We tried mapping between:

```typescript
// Core's spicetime (experimental model)
interface CoreSpicetime {
  discovery: Process
  perspective: Process
  permission: Process
}

// Resource patterns
interface ResourceSpicetime {
  allocation: Pattern
  usage: Pattern
  evolution: Pattern
}
```

Early results suggest:

1. The mapping seems clean
2. Patterns appear preserved
3. Results look practical

## What We're Learning

### About Spicetime

- Seems to have useful structure
- Patterns might be mappable
- Relationships could be preserved

### About QM

- Might be useful for mapping
- Could preserve patterns
- Worth exploring further

## Open Questions

1. Domain Mapping
    - How general is this approach?
    - What are the limitations?
    - Where does it break down?

2. Pattern Preservation
    - What patterns transfer well?
    - What gets lost?
    - How to verify preservation?

3. Practical Results
    - When is it actually useful?
    - What makes a good application?
    - How to measure success?

## Next Steps

1. More Experiments
    - Try different domains
    - Test limitations
    - Gather results

2. Theory Development
    - Refine concepts
    - Document patterns
    - Build understanding

3. Practical Tests
    - Implementation attempts
    - Result validation
    - Use case exploration

## Working Theory

QM might be useful as:

1. A mapping tool between domains
2. A way to preserve patterns
3. A source of practical solutions

But we need more exploration and validation.
