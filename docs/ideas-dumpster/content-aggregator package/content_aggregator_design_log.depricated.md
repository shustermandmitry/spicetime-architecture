# Log File: Content-Aggregator Package


## **Commit 1: Focus Definition**

### **Title**
Focus: Design of Content-Aggregator Package

### **Abstract & Description**
The main focus of this log is the design of a **content-aggregator package**. All subsequent milestones will align strictly with this focus and address aspects such as architecture, technical specifications, implementation, and iteration.

### **Reasons & Motivation**
Content aggregation is vital for organizing and retrieving data from diverse sources. A dedicated package will abstract the complexity, making it reusable across various projects.

## **Commit 2: Architectural Decisions**

### **Title**
Initial Architecture for Content-Aggregator Package

### **Abstract & Description**
Outlined the high-level architecture for the content-aggregator package:
1. **Input Sources**:
   - APIs
   - Databases
   - Filesystem (e.g., JSON, CSV)
2. **Processing Pipeline**:
   - Normalize content sources into a consistent data model.
   - Apply transformations or enrich content.
3. **Output**:
   - Serve processed data via a unified API or storage (e.g., MongoDB, JSON file).

This architecture ensures extendability, reusability, and separation of concerns.

### **Code Snippets & Examples**
None yet, as this focuses on architectural design.

### **Reasons & Motivation**
Proper structure is essential for ensuring the scalability and robustness of the package.

## **Commit 3: Core Features Design**

### **Title**
Design of Core Features for Content-Aggregator Package

### **Abstract & Description**
The following core features were identified for the package:
1. **Source Connectors**:
   - APIs: Fetch data from REST/GraphQL endpoints.
   - Filesystem: Read from local files (e.g., JSON, CSV).
   - Databases: Support for MongoDB first, with potential for other DBs.
2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Support custom transformation pipelines using a middleware pattern.
3. **Content Storage**:
   - Processed content will be optionally stored in MongoDB.
   - Direct API delivery of processed content will also be supported.

### **Reasons & Motivation**
The design ensures adaptability to multiple content types, making the package suitable for a broad range of use cases.

## **Commit 4: Initial Implementation Plan**

### **Title**
Implementation Plan for Content-Aggregator Package

### **Abstract & Description**
The implementation plan was defined as follows:
1. **Project Setup**:
   - Use TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.
   - Integrate a testing framework (e.g., Vitest) for validating functionality.
2. **Stepwise Development**:
   1. Implement connectors for APIs, MongoDB, and JSON files.
   2. Add content normalization logic to unify data formats.
   3. Develop transformation pipeline middleware.
   4. Provide REST/GraphQL API for content access.
3. **Documentation**:
   - Use Typedoc for auto-generated API documentation.

### **Reasons & Motivation**
Defining the implementation plan early ensures efficient development and avoids scope creep.

---

## **Commit 5: Testing and Validation**

### **Title**
Testing Strategy for Content-Aggregator Package

### **Abstract & Description**
Outlined the strategy for testing the package:
1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test each connector individually.
   - Validate data transformation methods.
2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Ensure end-to-end functionality of the pipeline.
   - Simulate real-world data sources and scenarios.
3. **Documentation Validation**:
   - Verify that Typedoc generates complete and accurate API documentation.

### **Reasons & Motivation**
Testing ensures the reliability and quality of the package, particularly core features like aggregation and transformation.

## **Commit 6: Future Features and Extensions**

### **Title**
Future Features and Extensions for Content-Aggregator Package

### **Abstract & Description**
Identified potential future enhancements:
1. **Additional Source Connectors**:
   - RSS feeds
   - Social media APIs
2. **Caching Layer**:
   - Cache frequently accessed content for performance.
3. **Message Queues**:
   - Integrate support for message queues like RabbitMQ or Kafka for real-time updates.
4. **Config-Driven Pipelines**:
   - Allow users to define the transformation and aggregation steps through configuration files.

### **Reasons & Motivation**
