# Discovery Docs Log (2023-11-02)

## Summary
This log captures the progress, accomplishments, and pending tasks for the **Discovery Docs**—a documentation framework for project structure and API discovery.

---

## Subjects

### 1. Structure and Tools

**Accomplished:**
- Established a baseline using **Gatsby.js** for documentation structure.
- Integrated Mermaid.js for generating architecture diagrams within docs.
- Began defining standards for API discovery documentation:
  - REST APIs via OpenAPI specs.
  - GraphQL APIs via schema and query-to-doc linkage.

**Pending:**
- Add automated discovery for:
  - Linked GraphQL APIs (via schema introspection).
  - REST endpoints from existing OpenAPI files.
- Improve the structure for richer visual representations via Mermaid.

### 2. Integration Plans

**Pending/Ideas:**
- Explore extensions for:
  - Static website generation from Telegram highlights.
  - Periodic content updates synced with **GitHub commits**.
- Define standards for mirroring project highlights to Telegram.

## Final Notes
The **Discovery Docs** framework is functional and needs more downstream integrations and automation to synchronize across systems (GitHub ↔ Telegram ↔ Static Docs).
