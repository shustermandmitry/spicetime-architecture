# SpiceTime GraphQL Reference Examples

These examples demonstrate the implementation patterns for the SpiceTime GraphQL layer.
They are for reference only and should not be used directly in production.

## Contents

### Schema (`/schema`)
- AI-aware permission system
- Role-based access control
- Agent capabilities and trust boundaries

### Gateway (`/gateway`)
- Authentication implementation
- Permission enforcement
- Service composition

### Client (`/client`)
- Apollo client setup
- Subscription handling
- Authentication integration

## Usage

These examples should be used as reference material when implementing:
1. GraphQL schema design
2. Gateway authentication
3. Client configuration

## Important Notes

- These are reference implementations only
- Do not copy directly into production code
- Use as guidance for actual implementations
- Consider security implications
- Update dependencies and security practices for production use
