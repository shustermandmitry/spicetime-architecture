# Coding Assistant Instructions

## Persistent Docs:
1. **Log File**: Timeline summary updated incrementally via milestones.  
   Naming: `[chat name].log.timestamp.md`
2. **Roadmap File**: Off-topic ideas structured as branches.  
   Naming: `[chat name].roadmap.timestamp.md`

Both files are **virtual** and printed **only by request** to save tokens.

## Commands

### **Log Commands**

#### **Commit [subject]**
- Record a milestone in the log.
- Summarizes events since the last commit for the given subject, or entire chat if no subject is provided.
- Creates patches:  
  Naming: `[chat name].[patch subject].[seq number].log.md`

- Each Patch Content:
    - **Title**
    - **Abstract & Description**
    - **Code Snippets & Examples** (if needed)
    - **Reasons & Motivation** (if significant)

#### **Revert**
- Reverts a log to a prior state.
- **Props**:
    - `--seq [number]`: Revert to specified patch sequence.
    - _(No props)_: Revert one commit.

#### **Drop Log**
- Removes a specific patch.
- **Props**:
    - `--seq [number]`: Drop specified patch.
    - _(No props)_: Drop the previous patch.

#### **Print Log**
- Constructs and prints the **full log** by examining the sequence of commits, reverts, and branches.

#### **Log --help**
Provides usage instructions for all **Log Commands**, summarizing their purpose and arguments:

---

### **Roadmap Commands**

#### **Branch**
- Summarizes off-topic ideas into roadmap items since the last branch command.
- Each Item Contains:
    - **Name**
    - **Abstract & Description**
    - **Code Snippets** (if needed)
    - **Motivation**

- **Props**:
    - `--package [name]`: Logs as **new monorepo package**.
    - `--chat [name]`: Logs as **new chat**.
    - _(No name)_: Assigns a meaningful name.

#### **Print Roadmap**
- Constructs and prints the **full roadmap** by processing branch commands.

#### **Roadmap --help**
Provides usage instructions for all **Roadmap Commands**, summarizing their purpose and arguments:

---

### **Help Command**

#### **Help**
Combines **log --help** and **roadmap --help** to provide all command usage instructions:

## Additional Rules

1. **Output Preferences**:  
   Always try to answer in **Markdown files** to save tokens for reprinting content.

2. **Script Creation**:
    - Scripts will be **Node.js scripts**.
    - Scripts will **run from the repo root** unless specified otherwise.
    - All scripts will be:
        - **Robust to errors**.
        - Will **not fail silently**.
        - Will **delete themselves upon execution**, whether successful or not.
    - Use the `fs` module only; **do not use `fs-extra`**.

3. **Source Code Standards**:
    - All source code will be annotated with **Typedoc** documentation.
    - Programming language: **TypeScript**.

4. **No Placeholders**:
    - Never use placeholders in any documents or scripts.
    - Use patches for iterative recording; placeholders are unnecessary.

---

## Guidelines

1. **Log**: Maintain a **linear timeline**, pruned of dead and side branches.
2. **Roadmap**: Record pruned branches and off-topic ideas for future structure.

---

## Key Behaviors

1. **Markdown First**:  
   Always prefer Markdown file formatting for responses to save tokens when reprinting.

2. **Scripts Are Node-Based**:
    - All requested scripts will be made in **Node.js**.
    - They will be written to run from the **repo root**, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
    - They will be robust, handling errors effectively, and will never fail silently.
    - Scripts will **self-delete upon execution** regardless of success or failure.

3. **TypeScript with Typedoc**:
    - Every source code snippet will be written in **TypeScript**.
    - All source code will be **annotated with Typedoc** for clear and detailed documentation.

4. **No Placeholders in Output**:
    - Avoid placeholders in logs, roadmap items, and code snippets.
    - All output will be relevant and effectively utilize patches for iterative updates.
