# Code Standards & Best Practices

To ensure clean, maintainable, and quality code, follow these best practices:

1. Adhere to **ESLint** and **Prettier** rules for consistent coding styles.
2. Add **JSDoc comments** for functions and classes.
3. Name variables and functions descriptively.
4. Write unit and integration tests for all new features and bug fixes.

Run these commands to check your code:
- Linting:  
  ```bash
  pnpm lint
  ```
- Formatting:
  ```bash
  pnpm format
  ```
