# Field Equations for Resource Flow Distortion

## 1. Fundamental Field Structure

### 1.1 Resource Flow Field
Base field represents undistorted resource flow:

$$
F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu
$$

where A_μ is the resource potential field

### 1.2 Conservation Law
Undistorted flow obeys:

$$
\partial_\mu F^{\mu\nu} = 0
$$

## 2. Mass-Inducing Distortions

### 2.1 Individual Distortion
Non-local business deals create source terms:

$$
\partial_\mu F^{\mu\nu} = j^{\nu}_{individual}
$$

where j^ν_individual represents flow through non-local connections

### 2.2 Community Redistribution
Taxation and redistribution add collective source:

$$
\partial_\mu F^{\mu\nu} = j^{\nu}_{individual} + j^{\nu}_{community}
$$

## 3. Mass Formation Equation

### 3.1 Combined Field Equation
Total field with both sources:

$$
\Box A^\mu - \partial^\mu(\partial_\nu A^\nu) = j^\mu_{total}
$$

### 3.2 Mass Density
Mass density emerges from field divergence:

$$
\rho = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = -\nabla^2 \phi
$$

where:
- E is economic field strength
- φ is resource potential

## 4. Community Dynamics

### 4.1 Taxation Field
Community redistribution creates field:

$$
\mathbf{E}_{tax} = -\nabla \phi_{tax}
$$

where φ_tax is tax potential based on ethical scoring

### 4.2 Total Field
Combined effect:

$$
\mathbf{E}_{total} = \mathbf{E}_{market} + \mathbf{E}_{tax}
$$

## 5. Conservation Laws

### 5.1 Energy-Mass Conservation
For closed system:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\int_V (\frac{1}{2}|\mathbf{E}|^2 + \rho\phi)dV = -\oint_S \mathbf{S} \cdot d\mathbf{A}
$$

where S is resource flow vector

### 5.2 Community Resource Balance
For taxation/redistribution:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}M_{community} = \int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}_{tax})dV
$$

## 6. Field Response

### 6.1 Market Response
Field responds to distortions:

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mathbf{j} + \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
$$

### 6.2 Equilibrium Condition
Stable state requires:

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} = 0
$$
