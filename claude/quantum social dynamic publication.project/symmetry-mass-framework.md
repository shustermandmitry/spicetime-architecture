# Mass from Broken Flow Symmetry

## 1. Fundamental Principles

### 1.1 Uniform Flow State
In perfectly symmetric space:

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = 0
$$

where f is resource flow vector field. All flows balance locally.

### 1.2 Symmetry Breaking
Mass emerges from non-local connections that violate flow equivalence:

$$
M \propto \oint_S (\mathbf{f}_{local} - \mathbf{f}_{nonlocal}) \cdot d\mathbf{A}
$$

where:
- f_local: Expected local flow pattern
- f_nonlocal: Actual flow including distant connections
- Surface integral measures the "kink" in flow

## 2. Network Dynamics

### 2.1 Local Causality
Proper local connections preserve symmetry:

$$
\mathbf{f}_{ij} \propto \frac{1}{d_{ij}^2}
$$

where d_ij is network distance between nodes

### 2.2 Symmetry Violation
Non-local links create distortions:

$$
\Delta_{symmetry} = \sum_{links} \left(1 - \frac{d_{local}}{d_{actual}}\right)
$$

Larger Î”_symmetry indicates more mass formation

## 3. Mass Formation

### 3.1 Flow Distortion
Mass accumulates where flows deviate from local causality:

$$
\frac{dM}{dt} = k \int_V |\nabla \times \mathbf{f}| dV
$$

Curl of flow field measures local symmetry breaking

### 3.2 Network Curvature
Non-local connections induce effective curvature:

$$
R = \frac{\text{actual path length}}{\text{minimal local path length}} - 1
$$

## 4. Equivalence Breaking

### 4.1 Local Flow Metric
For symmetric space:

$$
ds^2 = \sum_{local} df_i^2
$$

### 4.2 Distorted Metric
With non-local connections:

$$
ds^2 = g_{ij}df_i df_j
$$

where g_ij captures network distortion

## 5. Implementation Implications

### 5.1 Key Measurements
1. Local vs non-local flow ratios
2. Network path distortions
3. Flow field curvature
4. Symmetry violation metrics

### 5.2 Mass Indicators
1. Flow field discontinuities
2. Network metric distortions
3. Causal violation measures
4. Accumulated symmetry breaks

## Notes on Physical Analogy

1. Mass emerges from network topology
2. Non-local connections break symmetry
3. Flow distortions create persistence
4. System seeks minimal distortion

The framework emphasizes:
- Symmetry as natural state
- Mass from broken equivalence
- Flow distortion as fundamental measure
- Local causality preservation
