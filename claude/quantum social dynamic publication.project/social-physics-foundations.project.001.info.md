# Social Physics Foundations Project

## Purpose
Develop comprehensive theoretical framework mapping fundamental physics principles to social systems and community formation.

## Key Decisions
1. Focus on fundamental physical laws rather than analogies
2. Separate scientific content from accessibility materials
3. Structure for Gatsby site publication
4. Include both theoretical and vision tracks

## Test Standards
1. Mathematical consistency
2. Physical principle mapping accuracy
3. Implementation feasibility
4. Documentation clarity

## Current State
Initial theoretical framework developed covering:
- Permission field dynamics
- Mass formation principles
- Group formation patterns
- Implementation approaches

## Dependencies
- Quantum Social Dynamics Research Framework
- Technical Feasibility Overview
- Essential Context Documents
