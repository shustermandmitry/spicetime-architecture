# Abstract

We present a novel framework bridging quantum field theory and organizational dynamics through the ADM (Authoritarian-Democratic-Mediator) model of leadership. The framework demonstrates how organizational evolution follows patterns analogous to both quantum mechanics and general relativity, with leadership styles corresponding to fundamental charges in an SU(3) symmetry group, and organizational structure manifesting as geometric curvature in cultural space.

The theory provides testable predictions about group dynamics and organizational evolution, which we propose to validate through SpiceTime - a practical implementation platform combining theoretical insights with real-world measurements. Our approach translates these mathematical structures into composable React components, enabling practical application while maintaining theoretical rigor.

The framework encodes organizational physics in component composition rules and state transitions, allowing prediction and guidance of organizational evolution. Leadership combinations follow patterns similar to color confinement in quantum chromodynamics, while organizational resistance to change manifests as geometric curvature, demonstrating a unique unification of quantum and geometric descriptions in social systems.

This work suggests that social organizations may provide an ideal laboratory for studying quantum-geometric unification, as they allow simultaneous observation of both quantum (individual) and geometric (collective) behaviors in a way physical systems currently do not permit.
