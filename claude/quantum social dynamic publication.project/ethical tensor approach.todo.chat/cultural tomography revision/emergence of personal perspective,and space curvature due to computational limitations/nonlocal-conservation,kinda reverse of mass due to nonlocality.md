# Non-locality and Conservation in Social Networks

## 1. Local vs. Non-local Flow

### 1.1 Local Flow Problem
In a purely local network, apparent violations occur:

$$
\oint_{\partial V} J \cdot dA \neq 0
$$

Information/wealth appears to leak from closed volumes.

### 1.2 Conservation Restoration
Non-local connections restore conservation:

$$
\oint_{\partial V} (J_{\text{local}} + J_{\text{nonlocal}}) \cdot dA = 0
$$

## 2. Causal Structure

### 2.1 Lorentz Invariance
Non-locality must preserve causality:

$$
(x_1 - x_2)^2 \geq 0
$$

for all causally connected events.

### 2.2 Quantum-like Entanglement
Social connections create entanglement-like correlations:

$$
\langle AB \rangle \neq \langle A \rangle\langle B \rangle
$$

allowing instant apparent "flow" while preserving causality.

## 3. Symmetry Conservation

### 3.1 Local Symmetry Breaking
Apparent local symmetry violations:

$$
\frac{\partial j^\mu}{\partial x^\mu} \neq 0
$$

### 3.2 Global Conservation
Non-local connections restore symmetry:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu}(j^\mu_{\text{local}} + j^\mu_{\text{nonlocal}}) = 0
$$
