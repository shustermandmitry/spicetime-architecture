# Quantum Social Dynamics Project

## Project Purpose
Develop a practical implementation of community economic systems based on hypergraph dynamics theory, with focus on:
- Permission structure management
- Resource flow tracking
- Cultural thermodynamics
- Leadership dynamics

## Test Standards
1. Mathematical Consistency
- Verify mappings to Wolfram/Gorard framework
- Validate conservation principles
- Test field equation emergence

2. Implementation Validation
- Permission structure functionality
- Resource flow tracking accuracy
- Cultural state measurement
- Leadership pattern detection

3. System Integration
- Component interaction testing
- Data flow validation
- Performance metrics
- Security verification

## Current State
