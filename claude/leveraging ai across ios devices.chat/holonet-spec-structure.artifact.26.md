sure, but this is a spec, not a detailed design effort yet
keep esoteric stuff like this on the perimeter as addendums, to tickle minds with exciting possibilities in community governance


You're absolutely right. Let me reorganize the documentation structure to maintain a clear core spec while capturing these exciting possibilities as addendums.


HoloNet Specification Structure

Would you like me to:

Expand any section of the core specification?
Detail specific technical appendices?
Develop particular addendums?
Outline implementation guidelines?
The goal is to provide a solid foundation for implementation while preserving the exciting theoretical possibilities for those interested in deeper exploration.
# HoloNet System Specification
