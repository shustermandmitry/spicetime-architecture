/*
of course, a person can take aim generated defaults and align perfectly with his community, or express his individuality. the results might not necessarily be detrimental, as defaults are based on some bland averaging and an individual can earn a better score by adjusting his permission structure to his context


Exactly! It's like the difference between following a default investment portfolio versus crafting one that perfectly matches your unique situation and risk tolerance.


Contextual Permission Optimization
Click to open code
This system shows how personalized permission structures can excel by:

Context Optimization:
Personal relationship patterns
Activity specializations
Unique constraints
Specific needs
Performance Tracking:
Comparison to defaults
Efficiency gains
Effectiveness metrics
Risk assessment
Individual Benefits:
Better fit to actual needs
Higher performance potential
More efficient permissions
Reduced friction
Smart Divergence:
Only differs where beneficial
Maintains community alignment
Optimizes for context
Manages risks
The key insight is that defaults are starting points, not destinations. Like a tailored suit versus off-the-rack, personalized permission structures can:

Better fit individual needs
Perform better in specific contexts
Create unique advantages
Still maintain community standards
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects?
