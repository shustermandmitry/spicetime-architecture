# Energy Flows as Mass Predictors in Economic Space

## Key Insight

Energy flows (transaction patterns and fund movements) predict and create mass accumulation, rather than being exactly
equivalent to it. By adjusting non-local connections and rearranging fund flows, we can influence where mass will
accumulate.

## Flow-to-Mass Relationship

### Energy Flow Patterns

1. Transaction Networks
    - Direction of flows
    - Volume of transactions
    - Frequency of connections
    - Pattern stability

2. Non-Local Connections
    - Tax routing rules
    - Distribution patterns
    - Connection strength
    - Network topology

3. Flow Adjustments
    - Routing modifications
    - Rate changes
    - Connection strength tuning
    - Pattern shifts

### Mass Formation

1. Prediction Phase
    - Energy flows indicate future mass
    - Pattern stability suggests permanence
    - Flow volume predicts mass size
    - Network topology hints at distribution

2. Accumulation Phase
    - Flows gradually create mass
    - Stable patterns lead to stable mass
    - Flow volume determines accumulation rate
    - Network structure shapes mass distribution

3. Stabilization Phase
    - Mass reinforces flow patterns
    - Creates self-sustaining structures
    - Establishes stable centers
    - Forms persistent networks

## Practical Implementation

### Flow Control System

```typescript
interface FlowControl {
  // Energy flow patterns
  flows: {
    routes: Map<NodeId, NodeId>    // Connection map
    volumes: Map<NodeId, number>    // Flow amounts
    frequencies: Map<NodeId, number> // Connection rates
  }

  // Adjustment mechanisms
  adjustments: {
    reroute: (from: NodeId, to: NodeId) => void
    modifyRate: (route: RouteId, factor: number) => void
    changeStrength: (connection: ConnectionId, delta: number) => void
  }

  // Mass prediction
  predictions: {
    calculateFutureMass: (flows: FlowPattern) => MassDistribution
    estimateStability: (flows: FlowPattern) => StabilityMetrics
    predictAccumulation: (flows: FlowPattern) => AccumulationRate
  }
}
```

### Mass Formation Monitor

```typescript
interface MassMonitor {
  // Track flow patterns
  flowMetrics: {
    currentPatterns: FlowPattern
    stability: number
    volume: number
    distribution: Distribution
  }

  // Monitor mass formation
  massMetrics: {
    currentMass: MassDistribution
    formationRate: number
    stability: number
    correlation: number  // With predicted patterns
  }

  // Compare prediction accuracy
  analysis: {
    compareWithPrediction: (actual: MassDistribution) => Accuracy
    adjustPredictionModel: (error: PredictionError) => void
    updateCorrelations: (flows: FlowPattern, mass: MassDistribution) => void
  }
}
```
