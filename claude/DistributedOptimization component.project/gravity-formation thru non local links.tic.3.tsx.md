# Creating Initial Gravity Through Non-Local Connections

## Core Mechanism

### Non-Local Tax Field

1. Each transaction creates non-local connections to community fund
2. Tax rules apply uniformly across all nodes
3. This uniform application naturally creates spherical field
4. No other geometry is possible with uniform rules

### Gravity Well Formation

1. Initial Phase:
    - Rapid fund accumulation through transaction taxes
    - Each tax creates non-local connection to center
    - Uniform application across all nodes
    - Natural formation of spherical field

2. Field Properties:
    - Spherical by nature of uniform rules
    - Centered on community fund
    - Strength proportional to transaction volume
    - Shape determined by tax uniformity

3. Why It's Always Spherical:
    - Rules apply equally to all nodes
    - No preferential directions
    - Uniform tax rates create uniform tension
    - Result must have spherical symmetry

## System Evolution

### Initial Formation

1. Start with flat space (no community fund)
2. Apply uniform transaction tax
3. Create non-local connections to center
4. Natural formation of gravity well

### Growth Pattern

1. Each transaction:
    - Creates non-local connection
    - Contributes to central mass
    - Strengthens gravity well
    - Maintains spherical symmetry

### Self-Reinforcement

1. Initial curvature attracts more activity
2. More activity deepens the well
3. Deeper well attracts more activity
4. Natural positive feedback loop

## Key Principles

### Uniformity is Critical

- Same rules for all nodes
- No directional preference
- Uniform tax rates
- Universal application

### Non-Local Connections

- Every transaction connects to center
- Creates space tension
- Forms gravitational structure
- Maintains spherical field

### Natural Formation

- No forced structure
- Emerges from uniform rules
- Always spherically symmetric
- Self-stabilizing pattern

## Practical Implementation

### Tax Structure

```typescript
interface TransactionTax {
  // Uniform rate for all transactions
  rate: number  // Same everywhere
  
  // Non-local connection to center
  connection: {
    source: TransactionNode
    center: CommunityFund
    strength: number  // Based on tax amount
  }
}
```

### Field Formation

```typescript
interface GravityField {
  // Natural spherical structure
  center: CommunityFund
  
  // Field properties
  properties: {
    strength: number      // Current depth
    radius: number       // Effective range
    curvature: number   // Space bending
  }
  
  // Always maintains spherical symmetry
  symmetry: 'spherical'  // Only option with uniform rules
}
```

### System Monitoring

```typescript
interface FieldMonitor {
  // Track formation
  metrics: {
    centerMass: number     // Fund accumulation
    fieldStrength: number  // Gravity depth
    activityLevel: number  // Transaction volume
  }
  
  // Verify properties
  verify: {
    uniformity: boolean    // Check tax application
    spherical: boolean     // Verify symmetry
    stability: boolean     // Check balance
  }
}
```

## Testing and Validation

### Key Metrics

1. Fund Accumulation Rate
2. Field Symmetry Measures
3. Activity Distribution
4. System Stability

### Critical Checks

1. Uniform Rule Application
2. Spherical Field Formation
3. Center Stability
4. Growth Pattern

## Best Practices

### 1. Initial Setup

- Start with uniform tax rate
- Allow natural center formation
- Don't force structure
- Let symmetry emerge

### 2. Monitoring

- Track fund accumulation
- Verify field symmetry
- Monitor activity patterns
- Check stability measures

### 3. Maintenance

- Maintain rule uniformity
- Allow natural evolution
- Support self-reinforcement
- Preserve spherical structure

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Non-Uniform Rules

- Creates asymmetric fields
- Destabilizes system
- Breaks natural formation
- Reduces effectiveness

### 2. Forced Structure

- Fights natural patterns
- Creates instability
- Reduces efficiency
- Wastes energy

### 3. Ignoring Symmetry

- Weakens gravity well
- Reduces effectiveness
- Creates imbalances
- Destabilizes system
