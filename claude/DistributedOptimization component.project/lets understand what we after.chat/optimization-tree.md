# Optimization Component Tree

## DistributedOptimization (Proto Component)

Basic QG transform algorithm for any domain pair optimization

- Handles tensor calculations
- Manages resource constraints
- Provides base optimization patterns

### Resource → Ethics Domain Pair

Child (Resource Domain):

- Memory allocation
- CPU utilization
- Network bandwidth

Parent (Ethics Domain):

- Openness measurement
- Accountability tracking
- Respect evaluation

Effects flow: Resource allocation enables ethical behavior measurement

### Permission → Ethics Domain Pair

Child (Permission Domain):

- Trust patterns
- Access controls
- Influence flows

Parent (Ethics Domain):

- Same O.A.R. dimensions
- Different gravity tensor
- Different measurement focus

Effects flow: Permission patterns shape ethical development

### Discovery → Community Domain Pair

Child (Discovery Domain):

- Cross-group connections
- Value matching
- Growth patterns

Parent (Community Domain):

- Group cohesion
- Value alignment
- Resilience measures

Effects flow: Discovery patterns build community structure

### Perspective → Knowledge Domain Pair

Child (Perspective Domain):

- Focus allocation
- View scope
- Time horizon

Parent (Knowledge Domain):

- Knowledge depth
- Understanding breadth
- Application capability

Effects flow: Perspective shapes knowledge development

## Implementation Notes

### Child Domain Properties

- Where actions happen
- Direct measurables
- Clear control points
- Resource bounded

### Parent Domain Properties

- Where gravity exists
- Emergent properties
- Natural organization
- Pattern formation

### Domain Pair Relationships

- Child actions affect parent state
- Parent gravity guides child behavior
- Tensor maps between spaces
- Natural optimization emerges

### Resource Management

- Each child domain constrained by resources
- Phone/server capability limits
- Optimization within bounds
- Natural priority emergence

This tree structure can grow as needed, adding new domain pairs while maintaining the basic child→parent pattern and QG
optimization approach.
