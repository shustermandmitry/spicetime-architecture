# Domain Optimization Tree Structure

## Proto Component (DistributedOptimization)

Base algorithm that implements QG transform between any domain pairs.
Provides core pattern: child domain (horizon) leads parent domain (bulk).

## Domain Pairs

### 1. Resource → Ethics

Child (Resource Domain - horizon):

- **Measurables**:
    - Memory (available RAM)
    - CPU (processing power)
    - Network (bandwidth)
- **Controls**:
    - Resource allocation
    - Priority setting
    - Usage patterns

Parent (Ethics Domain - bulk):

- **Dimensions**:
    - Openness (O)
    - Accountability (A)
    - Respect (R)
- **Gravity Effects**:
    - Resource usage shapes ethical behavior
    - Computational power enables ethical decisions
    - Network patterns influence community values

**Correlation Strength**: High

- Memory allocation strongly affects accountability tracking
- CPU usage directly enables ethical computation
- Network patterns shape community respect

### 2. Permission → Community

Child (Permission Domain - horizon):

- **Measurables**:
    - Trust levels
    - Access rights
    - Influence patterns
- **Controls**:
    - Permission granting
    - Trust evaluation
    - Influence flow control

Parent (Community Domain - bulk):

- **Dimensions**:
    - Cohesion
    - Values
    - Resilience
- **Gravity Effects**:
    - Trust patterns shape community bonds
    - Access rights affect value sharing
    - Influence flows build resilience

**Correlation Strength**: Very High

- Trust directly affects cohesion
- Access patterns shape value alignment
- Influence strongly impacts resilience

### 3. Discovery → Knowledge

Child (Discovery Domain - horizon):

- **Measurables**:
    - Cross-group connections
    - Information paths
    - Learning patterns
- **Controls**:
    - Connection formation
    - Path optimization
    - Pattern guidance

Parent (Knowledge Domain - bulk):

- **Dimensions**:
    - Understanding depth
    - Knowledge breadth
    - Application capability
- **Gravity Effects**:
    - Connections shape understanding
    - Paths build knowledge breadth
    - Patterns enable application

**Correlation Strength**: Medium-High

- Connections affect understanding
- Paths influence knowledge spread
- Patterns shape application ability

### 4. Perspective → Growth

Child (Perspective Domain - horizon):

- **Measurables**:
    - Focus allocation
    - View scope
    - Time horizon
- **Controls**:
    - Attention direction
    - Scope adjustment
    - Timeline management

Parent (Growth Domain - bulk):

- **Dimensions**:
    - Development depth
    - Adaptation range
    - Sustainability
- **Gravity Effects**:
    - Focus shapes development
    - Scope affects adaptation
    - Time horizon influences sustainability

**Correlation Strength**: Medium

- Focus partially affects development
- Scope loosely couples with adaptation
- Time horizon moderately influences sustainability

## Implementation Strategy

### Correlation-Based Priority

1. Start with highest correlation pairs
2. Build foundation with strong relationships
3. Add weaker correlations as enhancement
4. Monitor correlation strength changes

### Resource Management

1. Allocate more resources to strongly correlated pairs
2. Optimize resource usage based on correlation strength
3. Balance resource constraints with correlation benefits
4. Adjust based on measured effectiveness

### Optimization Flow

1. Manipulate horizon (child) metrics directly
2. Measure bulk (parent) effects
3. Adjust based on correlation strength
4. Iterate towards optimal state

### Success Metrics

1. Correlation strength maintenance
2. Resource efficiency
3. Goal achievement rate
4. System stability

## Extension Points

1. New domain pair identification
2. Correlation strength measurement
3. Resource requirement assessment
4. Integration strategy development
