### 3.1 Patch Management System
```python

    def __init__(self):
        self.id: str
        self.content: Any
        self.topic_path: List[str]
        self.confidence: float
        self.priority: float
        self.timestamp: datetime
        self.related_patches: List[str]
        self.usage_stats: UsageStats

class PatchManager:
    def create_patch(self, content, topic):
        # Generate patch
        # Assign initial priority
        # Store in Weaviate
        pass

    def update_patch_priority(self, patch_id):
        # Recalculate priority based on:
        # - Usage frequency
        # - Topic importance
        # - Age
        # - Related patch priorities
        pass

    def find_related_patches(self, patch):
        # Use Weaviate's vector search
        # Consider topic hierarchy
        # Return related patches
        pass
```

### 3.2 Topic Hierarchy Manager
```python
class TopicNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.id: str
        self.name: str
        self.priority: float
        self.children: List[TopicNode]
        self.patches: List[str]
        self.focus_score: float

class TopicManager:
    def adjust_topic_priority(self, topic_id):
        # Update priority based on:
        # - Child topic priorities
        # - Patch usage in topic
        # - Recent activity
        pass

    def split_topic(self, topic_id):
        # Analyze patch clusters
        # Identify diverging knowledge
        # Create new topic branches
        pass

    def merge_topics(self, topic_ids):
        # Evaluate topic similarity
        # Merge related topics
        # Adjust hierarchy
        pass
```

### 3.3 Priority Queue System
```python
class PriorityQueue:
    def calculate_priority(self, item):
        # Consider:
        # - Topic priority
        # - Resource availability
        # - Learning impact
        # - Time sensitivity
        pass

    def adjust_queue(self):
        # Rebalance queue based on:
        # - System load
        # - Topic focus
        # - Learning progress
        pass

    def schedule_learning(self):
        # Optimize for:
        # - Available resources
        # - Priority distribution
        # - Topic coverage
        pass
```
