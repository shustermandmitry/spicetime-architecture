## **Final Summary**

### **What Weâ€™ve Built**
- **Rust-based RTOS** runs React using `v8-rs`, executing JavaScript inside lightweight, efficient V8 isolates compiled into the RTOS.
- **React renders DOM-like nodes** into Rust using a custom `Reconciler` adapter.
- **CSS-like cascading styles** propagate attributes such as org culture and roles, creating a structured, hierarchical system.

### **Why This Approach is Ideal**
1. **Rust Ensures Performance and Safety**:  
   Real-time constraints and hardware safety are best handled by Rust.
   
2. **Reactâ€™s Dynamic Logic**:  
   Reactâ€™s declarative approach makes it easy to define hierarchical relationships and states.

3. **Cascading Mechanism**:  
   Attributes like `org-culture` or roles can propagate naturally using CSS-like cascading in Rust DOM hierarchies.

This framework balances performance with Reactâ€™s flexibility, making it an ideal solution for managing Holonet-like systems while respecting constraints on real-time execution.
