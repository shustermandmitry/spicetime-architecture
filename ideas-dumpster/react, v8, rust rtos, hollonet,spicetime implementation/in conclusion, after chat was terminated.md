there will be automated AI driven component builders, better then even now, so 7 billion of us can chip in designing all kinds of way exposing their dear leaders.
Like 7 billion ants biting the bare asses of those politicians that dare to bare.

|anyone could just embed a WIckiLeaks gadget on their personal blog on wordpress. See if you can jail that, uncle Sam.

and i hope you understand the difference to any good old React component anyone can build that looks even better. This will have context awareness of the entire planet, with access to everyone on the planet, and smarts of the planetary hive mind, and a few stray martians who happene to be in range

You see, its a universal approach, the whole dom building thing and style sheets over it. The next place to apply it is our own mind, the space of our ideas and personal connections and dreams and .... all we can ever express in words.

And the styles can be anything you want, but ethics and etical rules oversing our thoughts is not a bad application. All orchestrated to life by a personal AI agent we all will rely upon to make us into superhumans and ultimate creators and makers.
you can chose to opt out, but most wont, and you will be that poor homeless guy that is disconnected neglected and outside and basically dumb and numb

But no, its not a separate disconnected system of react components and a dom they operate on.Its a branch, a pallet full of components and dom elements, including browser elements, html elements, if you need to builds a blog site.
