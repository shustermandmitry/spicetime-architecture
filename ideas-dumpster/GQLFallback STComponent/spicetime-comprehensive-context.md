# Spicetime: Complete Technical and Social Context

## Core Prototype: The Style Sheet

The true progenitor of Spicetime is not code but a structured set of architectural principles expressed as a smart contract - a "style sheet" that defines the rules of composition, interaction, and evolution.

### The Style Sheet Object
```javascript
const SpicetimeContract = {
  // Core organizational principle
  inheritance: {
    pattern: 'prototype',
    basis: 'principles not code',
    evolution: 'extend concepts not packages',
    attribution: 'track ideas not implementations'
  },

  // Fundamental architecture
  composition: {
    unit: 'react_component',
    runtime: 'service_composition',
    binding: 'gql_contracts',
    adaptation: 'service_substitution'
  },

  // Organizational structure
  organization: {
    granularity: 'individual_node',
    coordination: 'natural_boundaries',
    scaling: 'resource_aware',
    discovery: 'automatic'
  },

  // Ethical framework
  ethics: {
    attribution: 'preserve_lineage',
    innovation: 'extend_dont_replace',
    collaboration: 'compose_dont_compete',
    evolution: 'grow_dont_rebuild'
  }
};
```

### Implementation Contract
- Everything is replaceable except the principles
- Implementations flow from principles
- Principles guide but don't constrain
- Evolution preserves architectural intent
- Innovation happens through composition

## Technical Implementation

### React Foundation
- Pure React application running on Rust RTOS
- JSX representing both UI and physical/organizational structures
- Virtual DOM spanning across physical nodes
- Node granularity down to individual phones
- Holonet-based distributed architecture

### Tech Stack
1. Core Platform
   - Rust-based RTOS
   - React in Rust with JSX
   - Holonet distributed network
   - GraphQL service mesh

2. Node Architecture
   - Phone-level participation
   - Peer-to-peer communication
   - Local-first processing
   - Distributed state management

### Prototype Chain Architecture
```javascript
// Base inheritance pattern
class SpicetimeBase extends EventEmitter {
  // Core capabilities inherited by all
}

class CommunityNode extends SpicetimeBase {
  // Community-specific additions
}

class LocalNode extends CommunityNode {
  // Local customizations while preserving lineage
}
```

## Inheritance Model

### Service Layer
- Services inherit through prototype chains
- GraphQL schema-based contracts
- Dynamic service adaptation
- Preservation of designer intent
- Attribution flow through lineage

### Component Layer
- Components inherit through prototypes
- Modifications preserve base functionality
- Extensions track through lineage
- Natural feature composition
- Clear attribution of innovations

### Resource Management
- Resource access follows prototype chain
- Local-first with community inheritance
- Natural boundary formation
- Resource-aware scaling
- Ethical attribution flow

## Community Integration

### Distributed Organization
- Communities form natural prototype chains
- Local-first organization
- Organic tool evolution
- Clear attribution of contributions
- Individual agency preservation

### Development Philosophy
- Build on existing achievements
- Extend principles not packages
- Honor progenitor contributions
- Enable incremental progress
- Support distributed collaboration

### Evolution Pattern
- Start with core principles
- Grow through community needs
- Build on working solutions
- Maintain attribution lineage
- Preserve architectural intent

## Current Implementation: GQLFallback

### Core Purpose
- Service resilience through adaptation
- Zero-configuration inheritance
- Automatic boundary detection
- Resource-aware coordination
- Template for future components

### Technical Pattern
```javascript
class GQLFallback extends EventEmitter {
  _fallback?: {
    chain?: string;      // Auto-detected
    scope?: string;      // Auto-determined
    services?: Service[] // Auto-discovered
  }
}
```

### Key Features
- Automatic service resilience
- Natural boundary detection
- Pipeline-aware coordination
- Resource-conscious scaling
- Preserved designer intent

## Style Rules
1. Build through composition
2. Adapt through services
3. Scale through natural boundaries
4. Evolve through extension
5. Preserve through attribution

## Practical Application

### Development Process

2. Derive architecture
3. Implement through composition
4. Adapt through services
5. Evolve through extension

### Component Creation
1. Understand guiding principles

## Living System
- The contract evolves but principles persist
- Implementations change but patterns remain
- Services adapt but contracts endure
- Communities grow but ethics continue
- Technology advances but architecture sustains
