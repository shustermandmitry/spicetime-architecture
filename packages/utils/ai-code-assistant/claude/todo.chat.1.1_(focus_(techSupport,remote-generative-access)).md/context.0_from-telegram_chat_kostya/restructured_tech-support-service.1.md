ith next evolution of this idea
its simpler
we have presets of remote automations, fixing known issues, and doing trial and error, composing known fixes, remotely, as a sub services
and theres a community/market of creators and consumers
so, its generative service
you talk to an agent, and he fixes on thye spot, or sends a request for service to community hackers, to make a few bucks, for himself, us and the hacker
its real simple, actually. remote automation is as simple as it gets
i bet that bad cache invalidation policy is reason why connectivity is so weird in many use cases
my thingy coiuld address that, and very effectively
it would take a duplex flow of info, between users and the service
it would monitor their system state, like keystrokes and changes to fs and system logs, and correlat to problems they report, and apply better inference to solving their problems
of course they can refuse permitions, then we charge them more for shittier service ;)
and keep rubbing that fact in, you are wasting your money on that service, untill you fess up to us
again, thats an obvious and ready field for my holographic optimization thru dimensions.
it implements those tensor transforms between correlated domains, read gravity, but does it inside the same model, as a plugin, that adds extra dimensions and imbeddings and adds its own error to the backprop mechanism"
basically, connections between neorons and weigts represent the tensors , in some aggregate sense, and it does tensor calculus, and adjusts tensor els, all at the same time, no math or/and statistics required
also, we can make it a bonus add on to our collaborative environment
inevitably, people will have local issues with os and hardware and the settings and environment.
I dont wanna spend my noghts debugging this stuff for 100s of users
thats a nightmare
and if we hire people for support, we not making any money, they do

So, pay a little for automated support, or pay a lot for me doing it for you
If i feel like it
