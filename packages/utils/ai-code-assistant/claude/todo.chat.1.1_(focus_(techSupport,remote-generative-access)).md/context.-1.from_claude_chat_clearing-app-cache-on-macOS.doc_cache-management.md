# App Cache Management Guide

## macOS

### System Methods
1. System Settings
   - Apple menu → System Settings → General → Storage
   - "Optimize Storage" option
   - "Remove cached files" feature

2. Terminal Commands
   ```bash
   # Clear all user cache
   rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/*
   
   # Clear system cache (requires admin)
   sudo rm -rf /Library/Caches/*
   ```

3. Library Access
   - Hidden by default
   - Access via Finder: Command + Shift + G → ~/Library
   - Alternative file managers (like QSpace) can show hidden files

### Application-Specific Cache
1. App Support Locations
   - ~/Library/Caches/[AppName]
   - ~/Library/Application Support/[AppName]
   - ~/Library/Containers/[AppName]

2. Development Tools
   - WebStorm/JetBrains: Found in ~/Library/Application Support/JetBrains
   - Xcode: ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData

## iOS (iPhone/iPad)

### Standard Methods
1. Settings App
   - Settings → General → iPhone Storage
   - Per-app storage management
   - "Offload Unused Apps" feature

2. App-Specific Options
   - Some apps provide built-in cache clearing
   - Safari: Settings → Safari → Clear History and Website Data
   - Social apps often have cache management in settings

### Limitations
1. System Restrictions
   - No system-wide cache clearing
   - Individual app management only
   - Sandbox restrictions
   - No direct filesystem access

2. Alternative Methods
   - Delete and reinstall apps
   - Sign out and back into apps
   - Use app's built-in reset features

## Automation Capabilities

### macOS
1. Filesystem Monitoring
   - FSEvents API
   - Terminal tools (fswatch, watchman)
   - Custom scripts and tools

2. User Action Monitoring
   - Accessibility API
   - System events
