Here's the sequence of our discussion, with key points and decisions:

1. Initial Question:
- You asked about GitHub Copilot with WebStorm
- Discussed common experience and comparison with JetBrains AI

2. Key Insight:
- Identified issue with using single AI for both generation and modifications
- Noted self-defeating cycle of context loss
- Proposed separation of AI layers (high-level/low-level)

3. Structure Development:
- Identified need for manager AI to bridge layers
- Explored OpenAI API capabilities
- Decided to build a gateway for multiple AI providers

4. Major Components Designed:
   a. AI Gateway/Manager:
    - Handles multiple providers
    - Routes requests
    - Manages context

b. Service Layers:
- AI Architect (high-level)
- Local Code AI
- Remote AI Services

c. Context Management:
- Architectural decisions
- Code changes
- Project state

5. Final Focus:
- Designed specs for two core utilities:
    - Patch: For code modifications
    - Aggregate: For context collection
- Detailed their interfaces, capabilities, and integration points

Key Files Created:
1. AI Context Manager (TypeScript)
2. AI Completion Service (TypeScript)
3. AI Gateway (TypeScript)
4. System Architecture Diagram (Mermaid)
5. System Specifications (Markdown)
6. Patch and Aggregate Specifications (Markdown)

This discussion evolved from a specific IDE integration question into designing a comprehensive AI-assisted 
development architecture with clear integration points and specifications.
