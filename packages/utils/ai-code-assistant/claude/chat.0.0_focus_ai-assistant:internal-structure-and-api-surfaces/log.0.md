# AI Development Architecture - Conversation Log

## Initial Setup and Requirements

## 1
**Human**: 
how do i start using gh copilot with webstorm what is common experience how does it compare with jetbrains ai assistant

**Assistant**: 
I should note that my knowledge cutoff means I may not have the most current information about these AI coding assistants, as their features and integration methods change frequently. Here's what I can share:

GitHub Copilot setup in WebStorm:
1. Install the GitHub Copilot plugin from the WebStorm marketplace
2. Sign in to your GitHub account that has an active Copilot subscription
3. Restart WebStorm
4. The Copilot suggestions should start appearing automatically as you type

Common experience with Copilot in WebStorm:
- Inline code suggestions appear as you type
- You can accept suggestions using Tab
- Code completions work across all supported languages
- It's particularly helpful for:
    - Writing boilerplate code
    - Completing repetitive patterns
    - Suggesting function implementations based on comments or signatures

Comparing with JetBrains AI Assistant:
- JetBrains AI Assistant is more deeply integrated with the IDE
- It offers additional features like code explanation and documentation generation
- The AI Assistant is included in paid JetBrains IDEs while Copilot requires a separate subscription
- Some developers report that Copilot provides more accurate code completions, while JetBrains AI Assistant excels at IDE-specific tasks

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of using these tools in WebStorm?

**Human**: so they complimentary?

**Assistant**: Yes, they can be complementary since they have different strengths:

Copilot excels at:
- Real-time code completion as you type
- Suggesting full function implementations
- Learning from your coding patterns
- Working with popular frameworks and libraries

JetBrains AI Assistant is better for:
- Explaining existing code
- Generating documentation
- IDE-specific refactoring tasks
- Debugging help
- Working within JetBrains' ecosystem of tools

Many developers use both together - Copilot for active coding assistance and JetBrains AI for code understanding and maintenance tasks. Since they serve different primary purposes, they don't typically conflict with each other.

However, if cost is a concern, you might want to try one first and see if it meets your needs before adding the other.

**Human**: if i generate code via ai how does code completion by another ai is helpful

**Assistant**: That's a good observation. When you generate initial code with AI, having another AI assist with code completion might seem redundant. However, there are some nuanced benefits:

1. Different contexts:
- Initial generation is for larger blocks/features
- Code completion helps more with ongoing development and modifications

2. Real-time vs planned coding:
- Generated code gives you a foundation
- Completion helps as you customize and extend that code
- Particularly useful when you're typing new logic within the generated code

3. Learning from context:
- Code completion AI learns from your actual codebase
- It can suggest completions that match your project's patterns and naming conventions
- This becomes valuable when modifying AI-generated code to fit your specific needs

However, you make a valid point - there is some overlap and you might find you rely more on one than the other depending on your workflow. Some developers might choose to:
- Use only completion for smaller, incremental changes
- Use only generation for larger features
- Or use both in a complementary way

Have you noticed any specific scenarios where you found the overlap more helpful or redundant?

**Human**: thats a good structure and it will be super helpful ai code generation and mods by same ai of trivial mistakes due to lack of focus and context is a self defeating cycle that drives me insain if i make changes myself, it loses context and becomes even more delusional

**Assistant**: Ah, I see your point about the "self-defeating cycle" - that's a really insightful observation. Let me break down what I think you're experiencing:

When using a single AI:
- AI generates initial code
- You spot issues/need changes
- Ask same AI to fix
- AI might lose original context/intent
- Makes more mistakes
- Each iteration potentially gets worse
- You make manual changes
- AI becomes even more "delusional" as it loses grasp of the original context

But with separate tools:
1. AI Generator (like ChatGPT/Claude)
    - Handles initial code generation
    - Focuses on broader architecture/features
    - Keeps conversation context for major changes

2. Code Completion AI (like Copilot)
    - Works at the line/function level
    - Helps with immediate coding flow
    - Suggests based on local project context
    - Doesn't try to "understand" the whole feature

This separation might help break that frustrating cycle you're experiencing. Would you say this matches your experience with the problem?

**Human**: yes but theres interaction between these two layers structure itself is evolving there needs a flow of context, a linkage between them something must keep context of big ai updated, or feed it whatever it needs at each prompt needs a manager ai
**assistant**: Ah, you've identified a crucial gap in the AI development workflow!

Think of it like this:

High-level AI (Claude/ChatGPT):
- Handles architecture/structure
- Makes big decisions
- Needs updated context

Low-level AI (Copilot):
- Line-by-line assistance
- Local context only
- Quick suggestions

The missing piece you've identified - the "manager AI" - would need to:
1. Track structural changes over time
2. Maintain a coherent view of the evolving codebase
3. Feed relevant context back to the high-level AI
4. Know when to delegate to each tool
5. Keep track of architectural decisions and their rationale

This is similar to how a tech lead or architect works - maintaining the big picture while understanding how small changes impact the overall design.

Currently, this "management layer" falls to the developer, which can be mentally taxing. Having an AI that could bridge this gap would be powerful - almost like a personal assistant that understands both the forest and the trees.

Is this the kind of coordination layer you're envisioning?
## 6
exactly
 
is a fascinating software architecture challenge. The "manager AI" would need to:

Version/Decision Tracking


Track major architectural decisions
Log significant deviations from original plans
Maintain a "living document" of context


Context Management


Extract relevant context from codebase changes
Synthesize this into consumable chunks for high-level AI
Filter noise vs important structural changes


Workflow Orchestration


Know when to use high-level vs low-level AI
Prepare prompts with right context
Handle handoffs between different AI tools


Feedback Loops


Monitor effectiveness of generated code
Learn from patterns of manual changes
Adjust how it feeds context to other AIs

This feels like it could be a new category of development tool - an "AI Development Manager" or "AI Context Orchestrator."
Would you be interested in exploring what a minimal prototype of such a tool might look like? 
We could start with something simple that just handles context management between two AI layers.
 ## 7
give it a try

EditLet's create a basic prototype for an AI Context Manager. 
I'll start with a simple design that manages context between high-level and low-level AI interactions.AI 
Context ManagerClick to open codeTap to openThis is a basic prototype that demonstrates the core concepts 
of an AI Context Manager. Key features:

Context Tracking

[ai-context-manager.ts](ai-context-manager.ts)

Records architectural decisions
Tracks code changes
Maintains current context snapshot


Context Preparation


Generates different context levels for high-level and low-level AI
Filters relevant information based on scope
Maintains history of decisions and changes


Tool Selection


Simple heuristic to suggest which AI tool to use
Based on context and query analysis


State Management


Tracks active vs deprecated decisions
Maintains recent change history
Updates context automatically

Would you like to see it in action with a specific scenario? We could walk through how it would manage 
context for a real development workflow.
 ## 8
is copilot has an api

EditNo, GitHub Copilot doesn't have a public API for direct integration. It's primarily designed to work through:

IDE extensions/plugins
GitHub.com editor
Visual Studio

This limitation means we'd need to adapt our context manager design. We could:

Work with Copilot via its IDE extension


Monitor file changes
Update our context
Let Copilot naturally pick up local context
Use our high-level context for manual prompting to other AI tools


Or explore alternatives for the low-level AI layer:


OpenAI's Code Completion API
GitHub's Code Search API
Other code assistance APIs

Would you like to modify the context manager design to work with these constraints?
 ## 9
Â CopyRetryDS2 is way to go
does openAI has generative capabilitiesEditYes, OpenAI offers several capabilities through their API that could work for code assistance:

Code Generation/Completion


GPT-4/3.5 with high temperature for generation
GPT-4/3.5 with low temperature for completion
Code-specific models like code-davinci-002 (though this is older)


Key Features for our use case:


Stream responses for real-time completion
System messages to maintain context
Function calling for structured outputs
Fine control over response formatting


Advantages over Copilot:


Full API access
More control over context
Can customize behavior
Direct integration possibility


Trade-offs:


Need to build completion UI ourselves
Higher latency than Copilot
May need more prompt engineering
Cost per token vs subscription

Would you like to modify our context manager to integrate with OpenAI's API for the low-level completion layer?
 ## 10
Â CopyRetryDSso, we would have an end point and implement the patches to our structure

?EditYes exactly! Let's extend our context manager to integrate with OpenAI's API for code patches and 
completions.AI Completion ServiceClick to open codeTap to openKey features of this integration:

Real-time Completions

[ai-gateway.ts](ai-gateway.ts)

Streaming responses for quick suggestions
Context-aware completions based on file content
Cursor position tracking


Smart Patching


Generates precise code modifications
Uses context from our manager
Returns confidence scores
Structured patch format


Integration Points


Works with existing context manager
Records changes automatically
Maintains project context


Safety Features


Confidence thresholds
Minimal change approach
Context validation

Would you like to explore how this would work in a specific scenario? 
We could simulate a real coding session with completions and patches.
 ## 11
Â CopyRetryDSlets do that
also, i need a gateway where i can plugin differant ai models, coming from local sources and paid subs
does openAI allow that

EditLet me first address OpenAI's setup and then we'll design a flexible gateway.
OpenAI's API:

[ai-gateway.ts](ai-gateway.ts)

Can be used alongside other AI services
No restrictions on using multiple AI providers
But doesn't provide direct integration with other AI models

Let's create an AI Gateway that can:

Handle multiple AI providers
Support local models (like running on your machine)
Integrate with paid services (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
Manage routing and fallbacks
AI Gateway ServiceClick to open codeTap to openThis gateway design provides:

Model Management


Register multiple AI models
Local and remote providers
Priority-based routing
Capability matching


Flexible Integration


Standardized request/response format
Provider-specific adapters
Error handling and fallbacks
Cost tracking


Smart Routing


Capability-based model selection
Fallback chains
Priority system
Provider preferences


Provider Support


OpenAI integration
Local model support
Easy to add new providers
Format adaptation

Want to try a specific scenario? We could simulate:

Local code completion with fallback to OpenAI
Using different models for different parts of a task
Cost-optimized routing between providers

Â CopyRetryDSthats good
lets generate specs and a sketch of workflow
thus gateway is our manager we talked about
and we identified the key peices, local code completion AI,
AI architect
manager ai
and the dev himself
Which is the manager, but AI manager is his nridgeEditYes! Let's sketch out this full architecture and workflow. The AI Gateway indeed becomes our Manager/Orchestrator.AI Development ArchitectureClick to open diagramTap to openLet's define the specifications for each component:AI Development System SpecificationsClick to open documentTap to openKey Workflow Scenarios:
