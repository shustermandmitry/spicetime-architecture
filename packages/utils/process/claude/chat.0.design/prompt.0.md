## processes
- have no notion of time
  - but have precisely defined transactions - natural boundaries at API surface
  defined precisely, by getter/setter indicating query or mutation. see below
  - primal to time
  - are gql schemas
  
## time is a process
  - of present becoming past
  - of future becoming present
  - has three proto layers - past


      - schemas are lexical
          - queries define meaning of nowns, els of state,
              - by consulting other processes
              - params of queries
                  - are context
                  - that define different meaning of a term,el of state,
              - are getter props in the state structure
          - mutations are verbs
