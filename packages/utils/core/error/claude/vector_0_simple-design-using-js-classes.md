## i have tried overdesigning this core package'
it simply does not work
- error package needs to be at very start
- needs to be dep free
- needs to be simple
- needs to provide error functionality for all core utils and beyound
## it can be extended later
to be as complicated as anything. growing along with spicetime bootstrap
