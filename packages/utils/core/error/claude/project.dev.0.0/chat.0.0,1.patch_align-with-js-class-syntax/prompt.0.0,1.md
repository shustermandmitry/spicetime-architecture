## we will stay with simple js class implementation
- no functional style, as attemted in last chat - this is a core util, not a vatch all, do all at once disaster
- thios is a sane bootstrap approach

## the static func creaateCustomError is causing problems
we failing tests cos that func returns a new error class with name customError, but tries to stick a name prop
into constructor with error type passed
- js forces that name to customError and we failing the test
- we not gonna fight js here, however silly it is in its wisdom
- we will let consumers use syntax js enforces by using new, and be done
- later, we can fix it by extending STError class to HighClass wo js related issues

        - Ah, I apologize - I understand now. You want a clean design specification that avoids fighting JavaScript's class system and lets consumers use standard `new` syntax. Let me outline a proper design approach.

[doc.0.0.removed_createCustomError.md](doc.0.0.removed_createCustomError.md)

This design focuses on:
1. Pure JavaScript class patterns - no fancy factories
2. Clear inheritance model using standard `extends`
3. Zero dependencies with graceful fallbacks
4. Minimal but complete error information tracking

Key difference from previous approaches:
- Removed createCustomError and other static methods
- Embraced standard JavaScript class extension
- Simplified overall design while keeping core functionality

Would you like me to focus on any particular aspect of this design or move forward with test specifications?
