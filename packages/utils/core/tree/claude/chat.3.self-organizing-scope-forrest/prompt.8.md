## prompt
first of all, lets stop producing ad hoc scripts, when im asking for very specific docs
it creates havoc in my thoughts
i cant handle starting from scratch on each prompt, jerking in the directions you pulling ne into
its good at beginning
now we identifuing major components of the design
you need to follow me, and maintain the set of docs we about to generate

we have these packages identified, as structure of domain package and its deps

NOTE that all funcs exposed by these packages are action funcs, as described in this chat,
pure funcs that are resolvers, and take a number of args, and the last one, to operate on, an executable state tree
its a system of composable apis, gql like executable schemas
of course, while bootstrapping, before full capacity of this sophisticated api is available, the funcs that execute not yet executable tree
are supplied as args, perhaps as a chain, to be composed

the structure containing these packages, and their names not necessarily creates those executable paths, delivering payloads to 
be operated on by each. thats the job of their dep structure. Thats what creates executable schemas, and its domain of funcionality, 
of executableSchema package below, that crawls the graph of deps
- tree;core util - provides basic tree functionality
- executableTree; util - provides a reactive tree, driven by fp
- forrest; util - provides tree registry and orchestration, and most importantly, hirearchial tree scopes,
from any perspective point within those trees. that gives a way to navigate thru entire domain structure, in one 
executable path, delivering a query or mutation, composed by the pure funcs along the path
- process; util - composes executable trees of local processes, with all possible workflows in each, as paths throug local spacetime
creating spacetime of a process, then process is entered with some initial value, and proceeds to ooperate in context of
current global state, as it happens.
- it can pause, waiting on a side effect, from outside
- time; util - provides tic functionality. so, in space package, we described how time works. I guess, in time, 
well describe how space works. Before that, 
  - time arranges, by tic patches, the structure, in accordance to the language of the domain, 
  - each domain has an fs part of its profile, that describes key files and their naming convention. complete story on that is in 
  packageManager util package. 
  - so, space is created different in each domain, according to its profile, in spicetime section.
  its not space, really, its spice, a subspace of space, not even, of spacetime, that is, each spice in
  spicetime is subset of spacetime.That simply means, spicetime is spacetime, organized in spice hirerarchies, spice trees, domains.
  and thats the highest level of abstraction. and we close on our structure, for spice is alias for domain
      - space forms out of time
      - space makes the time tic
      - and time tics create space
      - time tics are local, to their enclosing node
      - tics are global to a local node
    all its children nodes are ticked, at the same time
      - tic creates new object, by object.create, freezes the past proto, of that node, establish a blank,yet, present
      - if theres a roadmap key file in the spice the node belongs to, thats the future
      - spice is subspace, a jsx string, with a notion of position and metric, at least in browser window
      - domains and trees are not spices/spaces, like a component hierarchy has nothing to do with how their instances
    are positioned by css in some jsx string
      - but spicy spaces are riddled with components, and other domains
      - and each domain has a profile, with key files in it, managed by packageManager
      - so, all the roadmap files in those domains, is spice aggregate future, spread thru its volume
      - but thats the basis for predictions of the future, and that is done by some cognitive capable component
  - now i have to say this, thats about to send shivers thru simple minds. Its not so simple.
    - spaces form inside tree elements, thats where they live, enclosed into trees, in a fractal way
    - each package has its space, of modules, and functionalities, and ideas, and files and docs,
    and all of that can be positioned, by some fancy jsx string, running in a browser, and positioning those nodes
    using some notion of dimensions and metrix. perhaps defined by particular context and focus, and figured out thru 
    vectoring them as imbeddings and maybe using informational deltas as normalizing factor, but it might be completely 
    arbitrary as well, defined by user preferences, like arranging file drawers in his room
    - so, metrics are a concern separate from splitting content of a tree node, such as a package, into imbeddings, 
    which are nodes of space
    - and that split depends on context and focus, given apriory
    - so, there can be many spaces, cashed for a package, or a package type, a skeleton structure, package constructor,
    package scaffold
    - scaffolds dont have to live in file system. some graph db is fine, with boilerplate file content in mongo db
    - all the relational data and hashtags are in graph db, and trees are just a system of parent/child lionks
    - and spaces are nodes, that link to tree elements, and not necessarily to just one or in a single tree. 
    - yeah, its a mess, thats why we organize it in domains and spaces that structure domain elements
    - but domains, trees can form spaces as well - they all have some self contained meaning, and description, and title.
    so they can be semantically positioned. Why? I have no clue yet.
    - so, the obvious space to form, is in context of entire project, its goal and objectives, the whole monorepo.
    and thats space we will be talking about.a unified space of a webdev project
    - then its a part of a bigger scope, the team, organization, entire planet, all just objects in common reality
    - but anyone can get their own idea, and create their own embeddings and their own spice, out of same reality of content
    - so, time is mopre primal, then space.yes, division of time into tics is arbitrary, and subject to context, that is driving the space of
    project, but we could create a more granular tics, based just on keystrokes, without any sentactic meaning.
    just a sequence of actions, each producing a meaningless value.
    - then, anyone with an idea, and enough computing resources, can create any possible space out of that time sequence
    - but thats too much, and expensive, and we have a well defined objective, our project and organizational goals.
    so we structure time and space in that context
    - but provide some meta, to allow for other space organizations
    - and over time, in a lazily fashion, we create them, and cash in storage layer, with a time tag, which is semver.
    but more about it in packageManager
    - one such space can be project management space, where team members, and projects and tasks and subteams are the nodes, as well as packages
    - or a different space of our project, with a different package organization, under different point of view, or optional strategy,
    - a what if type of thing
    - and these wopuld form digfferent major versions of everything inside our monorepo
  - so how does our context forms space and time of our webdev project?
    * i already described the patterns of tic formation, based on patterns of deps requested, and notion of self contained meaning within tics, 
    as patches of additional functionality.
    * btw, a dep can be self contained, and self caused, by future tic, requesting a dep, when it makes sense. simply, its up to me, to call a tic,
    even if theres no takers, in my best judgement. Or it can be ai. Simply, we splitting timely patches into tics, semantically, to lexically. 
    and we freezing previous tics, just to keep out of trouble, when we reference those tics later
    * so, when someone references a tic, as a dep, he immediately object.creates a progeny of tic, with old tic as proto,
    and prbly extends it with a summary, going back tic past, following proto chain, and creating summaries
    * that new object is a node of space, in the node that just got a new dep, and a string of a dep link attached, as meta.
    in its package.json, prbly
    * but it does not have to be a package
  - so, whats that tic object? - it implies some structure.
    * yes, thats right. A tic can be split in vectors, each on specific foccus.and at times, not even closely related to the subject of 
    containing container, whatever it is, like a claude chat, or even claude project where chat is. and those vectors are persistent and jump
    tics and soaces and hop between branches. Uncivilized monkeys, out of control. Just like our thoughts are. but thats where creativity is burried,
    unleashed by the chaos
    * and organized by space. another node, or even a tic, in another tree, can reference off a vector, or a few, of a tic, taking just a subset of vectors,
    by using ramda pick func, thru the proto chain, but pick will do it automatically, no special heroics necessary
  - in summary, creation of node is strictly the business of an outsider. he gets to keep the new node.but he freezers our past tics, and has influence
  on tic formation, locally
  - so what does space package actually do?
    * it tells time to do the tic, waits till time is right, and gets his tic object, subject to his vector picking focuses, a list of vectors, in simplest form
    * it creates a space node, with proper links to its lineage
    * it gives it some name, but some kinda arrangement of tic path, so it sits in predictable place in folder structure.
    That folder structure is created arbitrarily, but simplest is to just follow the extensions and syntax in names, as elements of path.
    alternatively, those extensions can be shuffled, within ech file name, to arrange folder structure in many ways, depending on domain and context
  - and finally, what does time package do? 
    * it listens to space, as space makes requests and suggestions, to mutate time, by creating new tics
    * it creates new tics, by doing object.create, the good old evolve func
    * new tic is a blank object, with a chain of protos, its passed tics
    * that object is structured into vector objects, each vector object is a vector scope, that evolves same way.
    * so, evolve goes two levels deep. it evolves tic object, as well as iyts vector objects
    * vector objects are full of files, i guess, which are props with a name indicating the title of a particular patch to vector.
    there can be several, as vectors themselves can be a bit granular, or theres a sequence of timely patches, in one tic, as idea was developed, 
    while tic was in present stage
    * so, time follows name conventions, according to domain and package profiles, and orchestrates file creation, at least the time indexes of file names
    * i guess it makes sense if time keeps track of semantic meaning in patches being added to vectors, and gives advice, or just creates new tics,
    when enough meaning accumulated, in all vectors being worked on
    * it can even declare a tic with some vecrtors not fulluy developped for a tic. then it defer those patches files into the next tic
    * so, time is intellegent, as all grandfarthers are. His nickname is GrandpaClock, or just Clock, but space has its own intellegence as well
    * it decides what choicy chunks of time to steal away from it.
    * and i have to add about space package. it behaves in context of spice, requesting its service with a query, or maybe mutation, if space is responsible for
    keeping the structure of spice in its data layer. it can be a subscription service, and it can be an instance of space component, subscribing to services of space util
    * then, out of my sense of symmetry, time has to do same

- executableSchema;util - functionality as described above
- space; util - in close correlation to time package. both operate on state, and produce next evolution of spacetime tree, 
provided as initial state. so time creates a state, as provided, global tic, whena mutation comes along, requesting to use a 
package as a dep. The mechanism is described in previous prompts. The notion of package version and its semver is provided by 
packageManager
  - space util does not make those decisions, when a chunk of timeline, in form of a sequence of tics, is to become a space node, 
  with its own self contained meaning 
  - thats area of concern for designProcess package, and the higher order version of it, which uses some cognitive analysis,
  not a util described below
  - but when decision is made, it does not happen right away, but when some other node decides to depend on that future node
- designProcess: util - its a variant of a process, the process of design, of anythingh, but we translayte anything to 
webDev domain. so,
    - heres what i told my collaborator.
    - as im creating the skeleton of the design
      i realize
      that theres a pattern to this process
      no matter how it happens
      bjt you get to the point
      where design closes on itself
      you realize how a bunch of, before disjointed names and packages
      pair up, and then merge, creating aliases, of former separate package names
      thats a process as well
      and its back and forth
      but it stabilalizes
      into a coherent version of the design
      a composite package
    -i wanna point out, as example, at how spice became alias for domain. dont matter that theres no package spice. 
  It couldv been a package, but we have domain already, the higher scope of this chat
    - and thats a condition of closure. we start finding aliases for our parent, within its children, defining itself,
    - thru the meaning of its kids
    - amnd thats how space is created. A closed timeline of tics, where theres a sense of self contained meaning, is a node
- semantecAggregator util - an extension of core util package called aggregator. it creates summaries of developing ideas 
during design process. it works in collaboration with packageManager, that provides package profiles, and defines key files
to process, in its summary secttion, and its fs section, which describes the meaning of those long names, as they basically, 
a cli lingo. Also, iyt uses services of aggregator util to collect files pointed out by package profile. Then it feeds it thru
some vectoring filter, and off to ai service, to create summaries, consumed by collaborators. heres what i told one of my collaborators, 
a super busy guy, that has very little time to read my s
  - listen, theres a pattern and a reason
to my spamming here
    - im trying to find a way,
    to collaborate
    on the level
    - of ideas
    but in the next dimension
    before they become solid
      - if we present to each other
      just polished summaries
      - which is what you do
      most of the time
      with most team members
        - we all work in isolation
        where ai generates
        summaries, and notifications, and feeds
      - the real collaboration
is on the level below that
and that is tricky
    - for there NO tools
    to do that
  - the trick is to have a duel direction feed, in two channels, for each collaborative project
        1. one for patches of condensed updates, the good bad and ugly, all tangents, failed ideas, 
        backtracks, and new insights 
        2. another, dedicated to discussions on those patches of updates
  - then, theres a higher order functionality, to coordinate correlated projects, and optimize their structure
    and to build on results of collaboration, providing insights, and new idea suggestions, as  third wheel, an AI service
  - but im starting to describe some other util or component, which is above the scope here, 
  a higher cognitive func that is in the realm opf distributed ai and ai coding assistant, withinn webdev domain
  - still, it will have to provide a schema sutable for such an agent to consume

we will talk about semver function of packageManager some other time. its already too much.

## answer
Thank you for this comprehensive overview. I understand we need to move from ad-hoc scripts to proper documentation of the identified packages and their relationships. Let me help organize this into proper package documentation.

[overview.md](docs.8.utils-design/overview.md)

I've documented the core packages with their primary responsibilities and APIs. Each package is designed to:
1. Take consistent state trees as arguments
2. Prepare for TreeRPC integration
3. Support the domain-driven development pattern

Would you like me to:
1. Expand any particular package's documentation?
2. Add more details about inter-package communication?
3. Detail the TreeRPC integration points?
4. Document the semantic processing patterns?

Or should we focus on a different aspect of the system?

## prompt 9
tree is a core util, in utils/core

## answer
Ah yes, let me correct that - tree is indeed a core utility in the utils/core directory. Let me revise the package structure and tree documentation.

[overview.1.add_tree-as-core-util.md](docs.8.utils-design/overview.1.add_tree-as-core-util.md)

I've corrected the package structure to show tree as a core utility under utils/core, and expanded its documentation to show its role as a foundational building block.

Key changes:
1. Moved tree under utils/core in structure
2. Enhanced tree API documentation
3. Added Action type to show state pattern
4. Included usage examples
5. Added integration notes

Would you like me to:
1. Expand the core tree API further?
2. Detail how other packages build on this core?
3. Add more usage patterns?
4. Something else?
