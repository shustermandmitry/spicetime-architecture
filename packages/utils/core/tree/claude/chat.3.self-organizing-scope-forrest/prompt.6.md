heres whats going on

ill use a webDev domain as a use case

im trying to develop a generalized case of domains in my folder structure

see if you can spot a pattern from oine use case.well adjust. one case is error prone

webdev is primarily a react land, with each folder a bag of children components for a parent compound 
in the parent folder

but react did not come from nowhere. theres a kinda meta structure of utils, that allowed creation of
functionalities inside react logic of state handling

and those utils came from composing some core util packages

note that each util and each component is a internal package in monorepo called spicetime-architecture

theres a spicetime-react-app package in packages folder
and then a system of compound components inj components folder next to it

theres another sibling on firstb level. the utils package

and utils have a core inside

its a bootstrap process. from core utils, to composed utils above, and beyond to composing components out of utils

so, it seems there are three subdomains in webDev domain

but web dev is a process, and goes from design to test specs/test files to incremental implementation, 
to pass the tests, for each file, and each package, and each compound, and finally the react app

and its a cycling process.each mod goes thru the same sequence, its own mini webDev process, but in different context, of a 
specific mode, and specific file, or package, or compound or react app

its a fractal pattern, but process is the same, process of webDev domain

but there are branches to that process.and those are processes as well, supporting the overall webDev process

project managemnt process, git workflow process, and process of collaboration, using tools, of which git is just one

so, it brings us to that toolbox.each subprocess has its own tools, in addition to tools it can see in tools scope

it can not see thru siblings toolboxes, thats their business, and agains js function scope rules of visibility

but it can see what they expose, thru a var in upper scope called tools, which is in top webDev process scope, and is a normal js object/scope,
that can be navigated thru dot notation syntax and that path gets you to an object with a set of tools, exposed by a subprocess in the hierarchy

and the whole crazy system evolves, in time, tic by tic

and each tic is Object.create, which freezers the proto, and creates miutable now, till some package needs that part as a dep

he gets that dep, and locks into it, by semver

that generates a tic in the place of that dep package, and the new tic gets filled with wxtention space of mods, that
prbly were inspired by the dependant experience

meantime, no one can base off the tic in progress, till somehow, decision is reached, to reklease it

after that, anyone can base off it, and thats when tic happens

so, this whole thing im describing shopuld be a generalized gql service, or a component with a gql like executable schema, which is its reducer structure, flat

and each paren compound collects reducers amnd has a pipe, redux style, all the way uo and including react app level

and redux action events are the messaging system in that spacetime, of webDev

but, somehow, i have a feeling its a universal pattern, cos thats just how anything gets done, if it is to succeed, at getting ever done

so, where all the trees and the forrest come in?

each one of thopse scopes/hioerarchies is a tree, and each tree does same thiongs

it starts off from a seed that can come from a fossilSeed, or be composed from other seeds by someSeed.breed
it can come from a branch, producing seeds by tree.branch.giveSeed or tree.giveSeed, or tree.branch.leaf.giveSeed
and each seed will be more specific as we get to leaf level, with a different set of tools

these toolboxes are themselves trees, which are structures of interpreters of domain languages, complete with runtime that makes trees rective

these runtimes, each in its own language, are the fractal runtime of spicetime

each is a separate process, in computer sense, execution process, not procedural process that defines receipes for doing something

but not topop far off, for they are based on such procedural processes, outlined by their structure

the space of processes in each subdomain is what defines that runtime, and automation it does, to help with those processes,
to take care of boilerplate

so practitioners can speak their opwn jargon, and being interpreted and generatively attended to, just from written or spoken speach

## answer
Ah, now I truly understand! You're describing a fascinating universal pattern of domain evolution through space and time. Let me break down what I understand and propose a refined design.

[doc.6.spicetime-domains.ts](doc.6.spicetime-domains.ts)

This design captures several key aspects of your vision:

1. Fractal Process Pattern:
```typescript
type Process = {
  steps: string[];
  subProcesses: Map<string, Process>;
  toolScope: ToolTree;
};
```

2. Evolution Through Tics:
```typescript
domain.tic('1.0.0');  // Create new extension space
domain.freeze();      // Lock for dependencies
```

3. Tool Trees with Scope Visibility:
```typescript
type ToolTree = {
  local: Map<string, Function>;    // Tools only visible here
  exposed: Map<string, Function>;  // Tools visible to parents
  children: Map<string, ToolTree>; // Nested scopes
};
```

4. Domain-Specific Languages and Runtimes:
```typescript
type Interpreter = {
  language: string;
  runtime: (code: string) => any;
  tools: Map<string, Function>;
};
```

5. Breeding New Domains:
```typescript
const newDomain = fossilSeed.breed('name', process)
  .grow('language', runtime);
```

The key insights implemented:

1. Everything is a tree (domains, tools, processes)
2. Each level mirrors the whole pattern
3. Evolution happens through tics in time
4. Tools are scoped to their domains
5. Each domain has its own language/runtime
6. The whole system is self-similar at different scales

Would you like me to:
1. Add more sophisticated process patterns?
2. Expand the interpreter system?
3. Add cross-domain communication?
4. Something else?

I find particularly interesting your insight about how this pattern might be universal - 
would you like to explore how it could apply to domains beyond webdev?
