## prompt 3
but before we impolement react, we have crawl in utility basemenet
and we start with a tree representation of an xml/jsx string
we need to define basic branch and leaf variaties, the process component domain
then we use that to build process trees, trees of component instances
and of course, processes component trees have types/domains, and these form scopes/trees, and we designing processes in a process builder windo full of process domain scopes, or pallets
we destruct right components out of component trees at the top of script, and use them to construct a new component
so its just normal react, and normal spicetime with iyts pattern of scope destriucts instead of imports
but we should have a build and design and the rest webdev stages
its same stages of bootstrap
we have a stage to build the base process components, like that tasking like components
then, domain specific components, then our process in our domain
but its not a linear process, and we go back and forth
as result, we work on three levels of generalization at once, not leaving the editor window, manmipulating all objects locally
but thats in future
we have to arrange our trees according to that vision
first, the base tools/components tree
then that tree is in toolbox of the next , families of processes, each with processDomain tree
and these form pallets/domain tools/scopes
so when we building some custom process, we collect relevant domainTrees, and get the components we need, to build our process tree, with a toolbox of all those domainTrees
as a root, i guess
thats exactly what it should be cal;led
we start tree with a root
but its the seed that grows roots and then tree
so, its just presets of domainTree collections, for other domains, and we feed it to createProcess, and it grows roots, and we build on top of that
so, what we build is a react app of a process
with gql scema, and redux reducers, and queries and mutations
but before that, we use utils to build trees, using tree syntax
later, we will convert to react
we need an exetable schema api to each process
its just a flat structure of redux like pure func reducers, action func as we described before, with their distinct profile
these form reducers, that perculate to the top, and theres a subset of public schema. and thats prbly designed apriory, as process definition.
so createProcess should take that schema as a prop
keep in mind, we not designing a react version of that
we designing a system of utils
but in same spirit, just trees
and processes must be transactional
they will be linked thru standardized interface of combining tasks into projects and larger tasks, and actions will be spreading out reactively
so we have to wait till transaction is done, before next tic
thats where time comes in
transactions are tics we were talking before. thats who drives time and requests those deps and tics
its the webdev process that does it in webdev domain
others work identically
and processes have life stages, just like webdev has design and test and implementation and build and prod stages
so, our process trees must accomodate for that structure
domainProcess trees have stages too, normal webdev stages
like we described before, theres a subscope for each stage, with stage tools

## answer 
I understand - you're right that we need to build the foundational tree utilities first. Let me break down what I understand about the core tree structure we need to build:



This design focuses on the core tree utilities needed before any React implementation. Key points:

1. Everything is a tree node with a variety/type that defines its role
2. Domains contain stages which contain tools/components
3. Processes are instances of domains with their own state/schema
4. Transactions drive time progression and maintain consistency

The process creation flow is:

1. Define domain trees with stages/tools
2. Compose domains into process palette
3. Create process instance from domains
4. Execute process through transactions

Does this align with your vision for the core utilities? The key is
building the tree foundation first, with React as an eventual view layer rather than the core model.

## prompt 4
Processes are instances of domains with their own state/schema

Thats prbly right. Had to hickup on that for a sec
i guess it makes sense to extend the domain pallet as its root
but then more domains can be added, by dropping into domain building stage and selecting more pallets
which evolves the pallet forrest and sticks it into our tree object, to overshadow the prop in the proto
so yes, you right

## prompt 5
lets not redesign trees
we already have that design
lets do incremental approach again
use those utils, like tree and executableTree as deps, and use their api


## prompt 6
thats not complete
i covered a lot of functionality
and i got most of it dropped

## prompt 7
hold on
lets write a spec, design doc, a complete description of functionality and usage, and reasons for design decisions
thats for starters

## answer
You're right - we need to start with a proper specification document that clearly outlines what we're building and why.

[doc.7.process-spec-v1.md](doc.7.process-spec-v1.md)

This is a first pass at a complete specification that covers:
1. Core requirements and purpose
2. Design decisions and rationale
3. Usage patterns
4. Implementation requirements
5. Performance/security considerations

The key is that it lays out WHAT we need to build and WHY, before getting into HOW.

Would you like me to:
1. Expand any section in more detail
2. Add additional requirements
3. Clarify any design decisions
4. Start breaking this down into implementation phases?
