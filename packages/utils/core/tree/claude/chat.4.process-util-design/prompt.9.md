## prompt 9
life stages imply its a timeline
that means its an evolving scope, of our entity, thru its stages
the process simply meanders from one stage to the other, driven by external factors, and internal logic

so, each layer of that lifeCycle object is a stage
and theres a proto to that bunch
i guess its the process itself

each stage has a set of actions, so lifeCycle is not a cycle but a lifeTree
from a stage we can see down scope and do any actions there
when we invoke those, we drop to that state
the action func updates curentStage in process proto, by a redux action, they are all redux actions
and updateStage is at the process proto level
its a reducer pattern, really
process is a structure of reducers
if change is not allowed, action returns with an error, or just throws an error

so its a normal redux reducer hook we are doing
and process is a parent compound component
and now we start building children components at design stage
and they go into a processTree, a prop in design stage
and thats our jsx string, at least later, when we convert a tree into jsx, and create a process component
so, now we will be building component tree of the process the hard way
by using react like syntax of createElement, but with process domain twist
and our state machine logic will be expressed in the redux state and action messages
but theres a component tree in each stage
we building something in each stage, itys just the value we are building
and every value is built by react, what else
so, maybe we building a config tree at config stage
so, dont sweat the value name, its just artifact, like you coined it
but artifacts are trees

so, process is an object, with a peculiar behaviour
the artifact in process layer, the proto, is API, the executable schema, just a subset of reducers
actually the stages each have those action funcs, right?
those are THE reducers
and thats the reducer structure, structured by stages
and process, the bottom layer is api layer
and theres state prop, and thats a tree
it would be cool to mix state with reducer actions, in the same object
we could use a prefix to actions, like verby do or make, something to separate from nowns of state
and now they live in semantec harmony
maybe along with articles and little helpers, of fp lineage, like map, and on, and with, and ADN, and the rest
those are prbly in API layer, visible to every stage
and thats the interpreter, the combo of state, and fp syntax
the whole runtime, in one object

hows that for elegance

## answer
This is a powerful insight. Let me revise the specification to capture this view of a process as an evolving scope with a tree of stages, where each stage has its actions/reducers, and everything is built with React-like patterns.

[doc.9.0.restructure_reacty-version.md](doc.9.0.restructure_reacty-version.md)

This revised design captures your key insights:
1. Process as a living tree evolving through stages
2. Stages as scopes with their own reducers/state
3. React-like patterns for building artifact trees
4. Unified runtime combining state, actions, and FP helpers

The elegance comes from:
- Natural semantic structure (state and actions living together)
- Stage-specific scopes and actions
- React-like composition patterns
- Clean FP runtime

Does this better capture your vision? I can elaborate on any aspect or revise further.
