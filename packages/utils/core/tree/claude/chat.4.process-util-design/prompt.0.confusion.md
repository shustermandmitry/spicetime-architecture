## prompt
we need to describe it, as any other package, shortly

its a constructor, of a process.

it exposes some func like createProcess

and it can build it incrementally, and mod it

- processes evolves, like anything else
- process is an instance of an executable tree
- so, thats how it builds increamantally, thru evolution of its tree
- but then its like an executable schema
- there are simple timelines of receipes living inside each package
they expose some api in form of queries and mutations
and thats how processes are entered, by requesting a mutaion, thru a hirerarchy of coherent apis
which constitute a process.

## so, a hierarchy of processes, basically
packages expose process part of api.
- each has some defined processes
but each api call is a process

my question to you
how and why are processes any different
tasking works same way
accessing an item in the tree works same way
sending a message that goes around thru structure is a process
how we generalize processes
i see that webdev process/component has life stages of design,test,build,production
and there are transitions
so webdev porocess works as a state machine
i dont know how to compose state machines
its not a good model
react is, and we just said that each component is a process
cos it has state logic operating on a state, and its stateful, so it waits till state evolves, so it can do the next task
but normal components are not organized right. its just not declarative as a process
it hides its state logic. just defines what it can do and what it needs to do it. then it does some ofuscated stuff, and each in its own way, thats what the issue is
how we can compose something so disorganized.which is ast, or some domain like task management, with its runtime. we are building spacetime domains with runtime each. we should not have an issue organizing a process domain. but i do.

maybe we should accept task management, and organize it along ast lines.pure ast and code is just too granular.tasks can describe the intent of what needs to be done on
process entry. but tasks dont travel along process tree. what travels is the products tasks produce. they are pure funcs
linking nodes opf results. tasking system reverses it

what do you make out of all that


## answer
Let me think through this systematically to help design the process package.

[doc.process-package-design.md](doc.process-package-design.md)

Key insights from this design:

1. Instead of fighting with state machines, we use evolution patterns and artifact flow to create natural process progression.

2. Each "stage" is really just an evolution pattern that becomes available when its required artifacts are present. This creates implicit staging without explicit state management.

3. Processes compose naturally through artifact flow - each process declares what artifacts it needs and produces, forming natural hierarchies.

4. By treating everything as evolution patterns operating on artifacts, we get a uniform model that works for everything from AST transformation to task management.

Does this resonate with your thinking about processes? The key is shifting from explicit state machines to emergent evolution through patterns and 
artifacts. Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any part of this design.

## prompt 1
the whole point is to have a declarative way to express what process does and what possibilities are and how do we use it to produce one of possible things it does.
like process of feature development
at each stage, it waits for humans to get something done, thenprocedes to next stage,
tell me how processes are implemented in other projects
