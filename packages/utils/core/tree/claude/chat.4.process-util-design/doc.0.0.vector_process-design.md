# Process Package Design

## Core Concept

A process is an executable tree that evolves through state transitions, but instead of explicit state machines, it uses evolution patterns to progress through stages naturally. Each stage produces artifacts that flow through the process tree.

## Key Characteristics

1. **Evolution-Based Progress**
   - Process is an executable tree that evolves
   - Stages emerge through evolution patterns
   - No explicit state machine transitions
   - Natural progression through transformations

2. **Artifact Flow**
   - Each stage produces concrete artifacts
   - Artifacts flow through process tree
   - Next stage triggered by artifact availability
   - Pure functions transform artifacts

3. **Declarative Composition**
   ```typescript
   type Process = ExecutableTree & {
     // Core identity
     id: string,
     
     // Evolution patterns define progression
     patterns: {
       current: Pattern[],
       available: Pattern[]
     },
     
     // Artifact flow
     artifacts: {
       required: ArtifactType[],
       produced: ArtifactType[]
     },
     
     // Current evolution state
     evolution: {
       stage: string,
       artifacts: Artifact[],
       pending: Pattern[]
     }
   };
   ```

## Core API

```typescript
const process = {
  // Create new process instance
  create: (id: string, patterns: Pattern[]) => Process,
  
  // Evolve process with new patterns
  evolve: (process: Process, patterns: Pattern[]) => Process,
  
  // Feed artifact into process
  feed: (process: Process, artifact: Artifact) => Process,
  
  // Extract produced artifacts
  artifacts: (process: Process) => Artifact[],
  
  // Compose processes into hierarchy
  compose: (processes: Process[]) => Process
};
```

## Evolution vs State Machines

Instead of explicit states and transitions, processes evolve through:

1. **Pattern Availability**
   - Patterns become available based on artifacts
   - No explicit state tracking needed
   - Natural flow through pattern activation

2. **Artifact-Driven Progress**
   - Stages complete by producing artifacts
   - Next stage activates on artifact availability
   - Flow emerges from artifact dependencies

3. **Natural Composition**
   - Processes compose through artifact flow
   - No explicit state synchronization
   - Natural process hierarchies emerge

## Integration with Other Packages

1. **Tree Package**
   - Process inherits executable tree behavior
   - Evolution patterns drive tree transformation
   - Tree structure maintains process hierarchy

2. **Space/Time**
   - Processes exist in spacetime continuum
   - Evolution patterns create time vectors
   - Process hierarchy forms space structure

3. **Schema Composition**
   - Processes expose uniform query interface
   - Mutations trigger evolution patterns
   - Subscriptions track artifact flow

## Process Composition Example

```typescript
// Component process
const componentProcess = process.create('component', [
  designPattern,
  testPattern,
  buildPattern
]);

// Feature process composes components
const featureProcess = process.create('feature', [
  requirementsPattern,
  componentProcess,
  integrationPattern
]);

// Product process forms hierarchy
const productProcess = process.compose([
  featureProcess,
  deploymentProcess,
  monitoringProcess
]);
```

## Key Insights

1. **Evolution over States**
   - Natural progression through patterns
   - No explicit state management
   - Emergence over prescription

2. **Artifact Flow over Task Management**
   - Focus on transformation products
   - Pure functions between stages
   - Natural dependencies through artifacts

3. **Declarative over Imperative**
   - Patterns declare capabilities
   - Artifacts declare dependencies
   - Flow emerges from declarations

## Best Practices

1. **Pattern Design**
   - Keep patterns focused and pure
   - Clear artifact inputs/outputs
   - Natural evolution steps

2. **Process Composition**
   - Compose through artifact flow
   - Let hierarchy emerge naturally
   - Focus on transformation clarity

3. **Integration**
   - Uniform query interface
   - Pure transformation functions
   - Clear artifact boundaries
