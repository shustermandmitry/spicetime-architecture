# Process Package Specification

## Purpose

The process package provides utilities for creating and managing executable process trees. A process represents any sequence of coordinated actions that:
- Progresses through defined stages
- Involves multiple participants
- Produces concrete artifacts
- Requires transactional consistency

## Core Requirements

1. **Process Structure**
   - Processes must be composable tree structures
   - Must support natural stage progression
   - Must track and manage artifacts
   - Must maintain transactional consistency

2. **Domain Integration**
   - Processes belong to specific domains
   - Domains provide tools and components
   - Domains form hierarchical scopes
   - Cross-domain composition must be supported

3. **State Management**
   - All state changes must be transactional
   - State must be immutable
   - Changes must be trackable
   - Time vectors must be maintained

4. **Task Management** 
   - Tasks must be assignable
   - Task completion produces artifacts
   - Task dependencies must be tracked
   - Tasks must integrate with transactions

## Design Decisions

### 1. Why Tree Structure
- Natural representation of hierarchical processes
- Easy composition and decomposition
- Clear parent-child relationships
- Well-suited for reactive patterns

### 2. Why Executable Trees
- Provides reactive update patterns
- Maintains transactional consistency
- Enables state tracking
- Supports event propagation

### 3. Why Domain Scopes
- Organizes related tools/components
- Enables hierarchical composition
- Maintains clean boundaries
- Supports cross-domain reuse

### 4. Why Transaction-Based
- Ensures state consistency
- Maintains time vectors
- Supports dependencies
- Enables rollback/recovery

## Usage Patterns

### 1. Process Definition
A process belongs to a domain and progresses through stages:
```typescript
type Process = {
  domain: Domain    // Process domain
  stage: string     // Current stage
  state: any        // Process state
  artifacts: any[]  // Produced artifacts
}
```

### 2. Stage Progression 
Stages represent distinct process phases:
```typescript
type Stage = {
  name: string      // Stage identifier
  tools: Tool[]     // Available tools
  artifacts: any[]  // Stage artifacts
}
```

### 3. Task Management
Tasks coordinate human actions:
```typescript
type Task = {
  id: string        // Task identifier
  assignee: string  // Assigned user
  artifact: string  // Required artifact
  status: string   // Task status
}
```

### 4. Transaction Handling
All changes happen in transactions:
```typescript
type Transaction = {
  id: string        // Transaction ID
  process: Process  // Target process
  action: Action    // Requested action
  deps: string[]    // Dependencies
  tic: number      // Time vector
}
```

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Core Package Dependencies
Must use existing utilities:
- `tree` - Base tree operations
- `executableTree` - Reactive patterns
- `forest` - Tree registry/scopes
- `time` - Transaction tics
- `space` - Space formation

### 2. API Requirements
Must expose consistent interface:
- Process creation/management
- Stage progression
- Task handling
- Transaction management

### 3. State Management
Must maintain:
- Immutable state
- Transaction consistency
- Time vector progression
- Event propagation

### 4. Integration Points
Must integrate with:
- Domain registries
- Tool palettes
- Task systems
- Time management

## Performance Requirements

1. **State Updates**
   - O(1) for simple updates
   - O(log n) for tree traversal
   - Constant memory overhead

2. **Transaction Processing**
   - Linear scaling with dependencies
   - Constant memory per transaction
   - Efficient rollback support

3. **Task Management**
   - O(1) task creation/update
   - O(log n) dependency checking
   - Linear scaling with task count

## Security Requirements

1. **Domain Isolation**
   - Domain boundaries enforced
   - Cross-domain access controlled
   - Tool access managed

2. **Transaction Safety**
   - Atomic operations
   - Rollback support
   - Dependency validation

## Error Handling

1. **Transaction Errors**
   - Must maintain consistency
   - Must support rollback
   - Must preserve state

2. **Task Errors**
   - Must handle timeouts
   - Must track failures
   - Must support retry

## Future Considerations

1. **Enhanced Domain Composition**
   - Richer domain relationships
   - Dynamic tool loading
   - Cross-domain optimization

2. **Advanced Task Patterns**
   - Task templating
   - Automated routing
   - Learning/adaptation

3. **Space/Time Integration**
   - Enhanced vector tracking
   - Spatial relationships
   - Temporal analysis

This specification will evolve as implementation proceeds and requirements are refined.
