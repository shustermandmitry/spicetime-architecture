# Process Merge Operations

## Core Concept

Process composition happens through operations on their structure. Rather than creating explicit composition interfaces, processes can be merged by operating directly on their stage structure and translating that to runtime structure.

## Structure Operations

### Base Operations

Process structure can be manipulated through standard operations:
- Extending base structure with new stages
- Mixing in additional functionality
- Transforming structure to new forms
- Preserving relationships through operations

### Stage Matching

When merging processes:
- Stages can be matched by name
- Matched stages can combine their functionality
- Unmatched stages can flow to top or bottom
- Stage relationships are preserved

### Structure Translation

The key innovation is that:
- Stage structure can translate to runtime structure
- Runtime structure preserves stage relationships
- Operations work on either representation
- Clean translation between forms

## Composition Patterns

### Direct Merge
Simplest form where:
- One process extends another
- Stages combine by name
- Unmatched stages append
- Proto chain preserves access

### Profile-Based
More sophisticated approach where:
- Merge profile guides composition
- Stages combine according to rules
- Artifacts flow as specified
- Relationships preserve according to profile

### Relationship-Driven
Advanced pattern where:
- Process relationships determine composition
- Stage merging follows relationship rules
- Artifacts flow through defined channels
- Structure evolves according to relationship

## Key Benefits

1. **Natural Composition**
   - Works with natural structure
   - Clear operation patterns
   - Intuitive stage merging
   - Clean artifact flow

2. **Flexible Integration**
   - Multiple merge strategies
   - Clear composition rules
   - Preserved relationships
   - Stage awareness

3. **Clean Evolution**  
   - Structure adapts naturally
   - Stages combine cleanly
   - Functionality preserves
   - Relationships maintain

## Implementation Considerations

While specific implementation will be covered separately, key points:
- Operations must preserve stage awareness
- Translations must maintain relationships
- Composition must respect boundaries
- Evolution must remain coherent
