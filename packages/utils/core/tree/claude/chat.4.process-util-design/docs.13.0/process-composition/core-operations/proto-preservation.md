# Proto Chain Preservation

## Core Concept

During process composition, the proto chain must be preserved to maintain:
- Stage hierarchy and visibility
- Inherited functionality
- Language evolution
- Scope relationships

## Chain Structure

### Stage Layering
Proto chain represents stage hierarchy:
- Process base forms root
- Stages layer through chain
- Each layer adds vocabulary
- Previous layers visible down chain

### Inheritance Flow
Proto chain enables natural inheritance:
- Base functionality flows down
- Each stage adds capabilities
- Lower stages see upper stages
- Chain preserves relationships

### Scope Visibility
Chain determines what each stage sees:
- Upper scopes visible to lower
- Stage boundaries preserved
- Context flows naturally
- Clean layering maintained

## Preservation Patterns

### During Composition
When processes combine:
- Chains must merge cleanly
- Stage relationships preserved
- Visibility rules maintained
- Context flow preserved

### During Evolution
As process evolves:
- Chain grows naturally
- Previous states accessible
- Relationships maintained
- Clean transitions

### During Translation
Between representations:
- Chain structure preserved
- Relationships mapped
- Visibility maintained
- Context carried forward

## Key Aspects

1. **Natural Hierarchy**
   - Clear stage layering
   - Clean inheritance
   - Preserved relationships
   - Scope visibility

2. **Chain Integrity**
   - During composition
   - Through evolution
   - Across translations
   - In operations

3. **Context Flow**
   - Natural progression
   - Preserved visibility
   - Clean transitions
   - Maintained relationships

The key is that proto chain preservation enables natural process evolution while maintaining stage relationships and scope visibility.
