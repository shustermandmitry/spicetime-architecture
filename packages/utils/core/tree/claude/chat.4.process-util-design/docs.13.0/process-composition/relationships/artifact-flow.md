# Artifact Flow Preservation

## Core Concept

During process composition, artifacts must:
- Flow naturally between stages
- Maintain their relationships
- Preserve their lineage
- Enable clean transformations

## Artifact Characteristics

### Identity
Artifacts maintain identity through:
- Unique identification
- Clear origin tracking
- Relationship preservation
- Evolution history

### Relationships
Artifacts relate through:
- Stage dependencies
- Transformation chains
- Tool interactions
- Process boundaries

### Context
Artifacts carry context:
- Creation environment
- Tool configurations
- Stage parameters
- Process state

## Flow Patterns

### Stage-to-Stage
Natural progression where:
- Artifacts flow downstream
- Each stage transforms
- Context maintained
- Chain preserved

### Cross-Process
During composition:
- Artifact paths merge
- Origins preserved
- Transformations align
- Contexts combine

### Tool Integration
Through tool chains:
- Tools process artifacts
- Transformations tracked
- Capabilities combined
- Flow maintained

## Preservation Requirements

### During Merge
When processes combine:
- Artifact paths must align
- Transformations must compose
- Tools must integrate
- Context must merge

### During Evolution
As processes evolve:
- Artifact history preserved
- Transformations adaptable
- Tools remain compatible
- Context maintains meaning

### During Translation
Between representations:
- Artifacts map cleanly
- Relationships preserved
- Tools translate naturally
- Context carries forward

## Key Aspects

1. **Natural Flow**
   - Clear pathways
   - Clean transitions
   - Preserved meaning
   - Coherent evolution

2. **Relationship Integrity**
   - Maintained connections
   - Clear dependencies
   - Tool integration
   - Context preservation

3. **Transformation Support**
   - Clean processing
   - Tool compatibility
   - Evolution support
   - Context adaptation

The key is maintaining artifact integrity and relationships throughout process composition and evolution.
