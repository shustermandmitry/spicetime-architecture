# Stage Matching and Composition

## Core Concept

When processes merge, their stages need to combine coherently. Stage matching determines how stages align and combine their functionality while preserving their essential characteristics and relationships.

## Matching Mechanics

### Name-Based Matching
- Stages with matching names can combine
- Common stages like 'design', 'build' naturally align
- Name matching enables automatic composition
- Custom naming allows explicit matching

### Functional Matching
- Stages can match based on their purpose
- Similar tool sets indicate matching stages
- Artifact types suggest stage alignment
- Functional equivalence guides matching

### Relationship Preservation
- Stage dependencies must be maintained
- Timeline ordering preserved
- Tool relationships respected
- Artifact flow paths maintained

## Composition Strategies

### Direct Combination
When stages match directly:
- State merges naturally
- Tools combine their capabilities
- Artifacts maintain lineage
- Stage context preserved

### Hierarchical Composition
When stages have hierarchical relationship:
- Parent stage provides context
- Child stages inherit capabilities
- Relationships flow through hierarchy
- Natural scope nesting

### Parallel Operation
When stages operate independently:
- Functionality remains separate
- Clear boundaries maintained
- Explicit interaction points
- Clean separation of concerns

## Stage Resolution

### Conflict Resolution
When stages conflict:
- Clear precedence rules
- Explicit override patterns
- Clean fallback strategy
- Maintained consistency

### Unmatched Stages
For stages without matches:
- Can flow to top of structure
- Can append to bottom
- Can merge with similar stages
- Profile determines placement

### Timeline Integration
How stages fit in process timeline:
- Order preservation
- Dependency maintenance
- Clean transitions
- Coherent flow

## Key Patterns

1. **Natural Alignment**
   - Common stages align
   - Similar functions combine
   - Clear composition
   - Preserved meaning

2. **Clean Boundaries**
   - Clear stage separation
   - Explicit relationships
   - Maintained independence
   - Controlled interaction

3. **Coherent Evolution**
   - Stages progress naturally
   - Relationships preserved
   - Timeline maintained
   - Clean transitions

The key is that stage matching enables natural process composition while maintaining stage characteristics and relationships.
