# Process Merge Strategies

## Core Concept

Process merging follows distinct strategies based on:
- Relationship between processes
- Stage structure compatibility
- Artifact flow requirements
- Tool integration needs

## Basic Strategies

### Direct Overlay
Simplest strategy where:
- Stages merge by name
- State combines directly
- Tools integrate automatically
- Clear precedence rules

### Scoped Merge
Preserves boundaries through:
- Namespace isolation
- Controlled interaction points
- Clear scope separation
- Selective exposure

### Functional Merge
Based on capabilities:
- Feature-based combination
- Tool compatibility
- Workflow alignment
- Interface matching

## Implementation Approaches

### By Structure
Structure determines merge:
- Stage organization drives combination
- Tool relationships guide integration
- Artifact paths influence flow
- Natural boundaries emerge

### By Relationship
Relationship guides strategy:
- Parent-child determines flow
- Peer relationships suggest boundaries
- Service patterns define interfaces
- Natural hierarchies form

### By Evolution
Evolution needs affect merge:
- Growth patterns considered
- Update paths preserved
- Version compatibility maintained
- Clean transitions enabled

## Key Considerations

1. **Clarity**
   - Clear merge rules
   - Predictable results
   - Maintained relationships
   - Understandable structure

2. **Flexibility**
   - Multiple strategies available
   - Adaptable to needs
   - Clean composition
   - Natural evolution

3. **Maintainability**
   - Updates manageable
   - Changes isolated
   - Dependencies clear
   - Relationships preserved

The key is selecting merge strategies that maintain process integrity while enabling natural composition.
