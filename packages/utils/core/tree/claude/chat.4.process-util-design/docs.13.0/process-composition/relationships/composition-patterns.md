# Process Composition Patterns

## Core Concept

Processes follow distinct composition patterns that determine:
- How they combine functionally
- How stages merge and interact
- How artifacts flow between them
- How relationships are preserved

## Basic Patterns

### Extension
Most straightforward pattern where:
- One process extends another's capabilities
- Stages overlay cleanly
- Clear inheritance chain
- Natural functionality growth

### Aggregation
Multiple processes combine where:
- Each maintains some independence
- Shared context coordinates
- Clear boundaries
- Explicit interaction points

### Transformation
Process structure transforms where:
- New form serves different purpose
- Core functionality preserved
- Relationships maintained
- Clean conversion

## Relationship Types

### Parent-Child
Hierarchical relationship where:
- Parent provides context
- Child inherits capabilities
- Clear dependency chain
- Natural nesting

### Peer-to-Peer
Equal relationship where:
- Processes share capabilities
- Mutual interaction points
- Balanced composition
- Clear boundaries

### Service-Client
Support relationship where:
- Service provides capabilities
- Client consumes functionality
- Clear interface
- Maintained independence

## Pattern Selection

### By Purpose
Choose pattern based on:
- Intended relationship
- Interaction needs
- Dependency requirements
- Evolution goals

### By Structure
Structure guides pattern:
- Stage compatibility
- Tool integration needs
- Artifact flow requirements
- Context sharing needs

### By Evolution
Evolution needs determine:
- Growth patterns
- Change management
- Version compatibility
- Update propagation

## Key Aspects

1. **Natural Relationships**
   - Clear purpose
   - Clean interaction
   - Preserved independence
   - Managed complexity

2. **Flexible Integration**
   - Multiple patterns
   - Clear boundaries
   - Clean composition
   - Maintained identity

3. **Evolution Support**
   - Natural growth
   - Clean updates
   - Version management
   - Relationship preservation

The key is that composition patterns provide clear, purposeful ways for processes to interact while maintaining their essential characteristics.
