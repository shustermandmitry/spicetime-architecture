# Process System Documentation

## Abstract

Processes are composable units of functionality that evolve through stages. The system enables natural process composition through operations on their structure, with reducers bundling state and actions into coherent units. Design focuses on clean composition and stage awareness.

## Documentation Structure

### 1. Process Composition Vector
#### Core Operations
- merge-operations.md - Structure operation patterns
- stage-matching.md - Stage composition mechanics
- profile-handling.md - Top/bottom merge profiles
- proto-preservation.md - Chain preservation patterns

#### Relationships
- composition-patterns.md - Process composition models
- merge-strategies.md - Stage merging approaches
- artifact-flow.md - Artifact preservation patterns

### 2. Structure Evolution Vector
#### Stage Structure
- timeline.md - Life stages progression
- stage-scopes.md - Stage scoping patterns
- transitions.md - Stage transition mechanics
- stage-artifacts.md - JSX and artifacts

#### Proto Structure
- process-base.md - Base process architecture
- proto-layers.md - Stage layering in proto
- visibility-rules.md - Scope visibility patterns
- structure-translation.md - Representation conversion

### 3. Reducer Pattern Vector
#### State/Action Units
- reducer-bundling.md - State/action packaging
- stage-awareness.md - Stage-aware reduction
- composition-units.md - Composable functionality

#### Pipeline
- action-flow.md - Redux action patterns

## Development Order

1. Core Operations Foundation
   - Merge operations
   - Stage matching
   - Profile handling
   - Proto preservation

2. Structure Mechanics
   - Stage structure
   - Proto architecture
   - Translation patterns
   - Scope visibility

3. Reducer Integration
   - State/action units
   - Stage awareness
   - Pipeline patterns

The key is maintaining direct alignment with our vector structure while preserving the relationships between composition, evolution, and reducer patterns.
