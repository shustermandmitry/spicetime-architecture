# Process Base Architecture

## Core Concept

The process base layer provides:
- Foundation for proto chain
- Core linguistic capabilities
- Base state structure
- Common functionality

## Base Structure 

### Core State
Base process maintains:
- Essential state elements
- Common stage requirements
- Shared context
- Foundation types

### Base Linguistics
Provides fundamental vocabulary:
- FP composition primitives
- Core verbs/actions
- Common nouns/state
- Basic composition patterns

### Proto Foundation
Establishes base for:
- Stage inheritance
- Scope layering
- Visibility rules
- Evolution patterns

## Base Capabilities

### State Management
Core state handling:
- State preservation
- Context management
- History tracking
- Relationship maintenance

### Stage Support
Base stage capabilities:
- Stage transitions
- Artifact handling
- Tool management
- Context flow

### Evolution Support
Fundamental evolution:
- Proto chain growth
- State transformation
- Context adaptation
- Relationship preservation

## Key Aspects

1. **Foundation Role**
   - Base capabilities
   - Core structure
   - Essential patterns
   - Clean extension

2. **Proto Support**
   - Chain foundation
   - Inheritance patterns
   - Scope basis
   - Evolution support

3. **Language Base**
   - Core vocabulary
   - Basic composition
   - Pattern foundation
   - Natural extension

The key is that process base provides a clean foundation that enables natural evolution while maintaining essential capabilities.
