# Stage Transitions

## Core Concept

Stage transitions must:
- Progress naturally through timeline
- Preserve state and relationships
- Maintain artifact continuity
- Enable clean evolution

## Transition Structure

### Progression Points
Transitions occur when:
- Stage artifacts complete
- State reaches readiness
- Dependencies satisfied
- Environment prepared

### State Preservation
During transition:
- Current state captured
- Context maintained
- Relationships preserved
- History recorded

### Tool Handoff
Tools transition through:
- Capability transfer
- State handover
- Context migration
- Configuration adaptation

## Transition Types

### Natural Evolution
Standard progression where:
- Next stage follows naturally
- Tools align automatically
- Artifacts flow smoothly
- Context transfers cleanly

### Conditional Movement
Gated transitions requiring:
- State validation
- Artifact verification
- Tool readiness
- Context preparation

### Forced Transition
Emergency or manual where:
- State safely captured
- Minimal context preserved
- Essential tools transferred
- Basic continuity maintained

## Key Aspects

1. **Clean Movement**
   - Natural progression
   - State preservation
   - Tool continuity
   - Artifact flow

2. **Context Maintenance**
   - State capture
   - Relationship preservation
   - Tool handoff
   - Configuration transfer

3. **Evolution Support**
   - Forward progress
   - History tracking
   - Recovery options
   - Clean rollback

The key is that transitions maintain process integrity while enabling natural evolution through stages.
