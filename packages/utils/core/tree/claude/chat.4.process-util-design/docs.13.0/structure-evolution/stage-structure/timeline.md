# Process Timeline and Life Stages

## Core Concept

A process naturally evolves through time as a sequence of life stages, where:
- Each stage represents a distinct phase
- Progress driven by internal/external factors
- State transforms through stages
- Artifacts mark progression

## Timeline Structure

### Natural Progression
Process flows through stages:
- Follows natural development path
- Each stage builds on previous
- Clear transition points
- Coherent evolution

### Stage Boundaries
Timeline divided by:
- Clear stage entry/exit
- Completed artifacts
- State requirements
- Tool availability

### Progress Markers
Evolution tracked through:
- Stage completion status
- Artifact creation
- State transformations
- Tool interactions

## Stage Advancement

### Driving Factors
Progress determined by:
- Internal state readiness
- External triggers
- Artifact completion
- Tool requirements

### State Evolution
As timeline advances:
- State transforms naturally
- Context accumulates
- Dependencies resolve
- Tools activate

### Artifact Flow
Through timeline:
- Each stage produces artifacts
- Artifacts enable progression
- Dependencies track naturally
- History preserved

## Key Aspects

1. **Natural Flow**
   - Clear progression
   - Stage boundaries
   - Progress indicators
   - Evolution tracking

2. **State Coherence**
   - Consistent transformation
   - Context preservation
   - Dependency management
   - Tool coordination

3. **Progress Management**
   - Clear indicators
   - Natural transitions
   - Artifact tracking
   - Evolution control

The key is that process timeline provides natural evolution through well-defined stages while maintaining coherent state and artifact progression.
