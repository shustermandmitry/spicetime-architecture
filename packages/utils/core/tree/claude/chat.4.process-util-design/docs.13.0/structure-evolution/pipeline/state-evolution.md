# State Evolution in Pipeline

## Core Concept

State evolves through the pipeline as:
- Natural progression through stages
- Coherent transformations via actions
- Context-aware changes 
- Relationship-preserving operations

## Evolution Structure

### State Flow
State changes follow:
- Stage-specific patterns
- Action-driven updates
- Context awareness
- Relationship maintenance

### Evolution Rules
Changes governed by:
- Stage boundaries
- Action authority
- Context validation
- Relationship constraints

### Pipeline Management
Pipeline ensures:
- State consistency
- Change tracking
- Context preservation
- Clean transitions

## Evolution Types

### Stage-Local
Within stage boundaries:
- Direct state access
- Immediate updates
- Clear context
- Fast resolution

### Cross-Stage
Between stages:
- Coordinated changes
- Context migration
- Tool adaptation
- Clean handoff

### System-Wide
Across process:
- Global consistency
- Relationship maintenance
- Context coherence
- Tool synchronization

## Key Aspects

1. **Natural Flow**
   - Clear progression
   - Stage awareness
   - Context preservation
   - Clean updates

2. **State Integrity**
   - Consistent changes
   - Clear boundaries
   - History tracking
   - Relationship maintenance

3. **Pipeline Integration**
   - Action coordination
   - State coherence
   - Context flow
   - Tool synchronization

The key is that state evolution maintains process integrity while enabling natural progression through stages.
