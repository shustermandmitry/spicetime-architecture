# Structure Translation

## Core Concept

Process structures must translate between representations while:
- Preserving essential relationships
- Maintaining stage awareness
- Enabling clean composition
- Supporting evolution

## Translation Types

### Stage to Proto Structure
Converting stage hierarchy to proto chain:
- Stages become proto layers
- Tools move to appropriate scope
- State distributes across layers
- Relationships maintained

### Proto to Runtime Structure
Transforming proto chain to executable form:
- Proto becomes inheritance
- Stages become runtime contexts
- Actions bind to proper scope
- State flows naturally

### Composition Translation
During process merging:
- Structures align appropriately
- Stages find correct level
- Tools integrate cleanly
- Artifacts preserve flow

## Translation Rules

### Relationship Preservation
During translation:
- Dependencies maintained
- Context boundaries respected
- Tool associations preserved
- Stage order maintained

### State Distribution
How state translates:
- Core state at root
- Stage-specific state local
- Shared state accessible
- Context flows properly

### Action Binding
Action translation ensures:
- Proper scope access
- Stage awareness
- Clean composition
- Natural flow

## Key Aspects

1. **Clean Mapping**
   - Clear translations
   - Preserved meaning
   - Natural structure
   - Efficient conversion

2. **Relationship Care**
   - Maintained connections
   - Proper scoping
   - Clear boundaries
   - Natural access

3. **Evolution Support**
   - Translation adaptability
   - Structure growth
   - Clean composition
   - Pattern preservation

The key is that translation enables different representations while maintaining essential structure and relationships.
