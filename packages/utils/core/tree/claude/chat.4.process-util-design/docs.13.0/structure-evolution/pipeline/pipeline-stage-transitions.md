# Pipeline Stage Transitions

## Core Concept

Stage transitions in the pipeline:
- Follow Redux action patterns
- Preserve stage context and state
- Manage tool and artifact handoff
- Enable clean stage evolution

## Transition Structure

### Action Sequence
Stage changes occur through:
- Transition initiation actions
- State preparation steps
- Context migration
- Completion validation

### State Management
During transition:
- Current state snapshot
- Context preservation
- Relationship maintenance
- History recording

### Pipeline Control
Pipeline manages:
- Action sequencing
- State consistency
- Context flow
- Tool coordination

## Transition Types

### Natural Progression
Standard flow where:
- Next stage determined by state
- Actions flow naturally
- State transforms cleanly
- Context migrates smoothly

### Controlled Movement
Managed transitions with:
- Explicit state validation
- Staged action sequence
- Coordinated tool handoff
- Clean context transfer

### Emergency Handling
Recovery transitions with:
- State preservation priority
- Essential context only
- Critical tool transfer
- Basic continuity

## Key Aspects

1. **Flow Control**
   - Clean sequencing
   - State integrity
   - Context preservation
   - Tool coordination

2. **State Management**
   - Consistent transitions
   - Clear boundaries
   - History tracking
   - Relationship maintenance

3. **Pipeline Integration**
   - Action coherence
   - State consistency
   - Context flow
   - Tool synchronization

The key is that stage transitions follow Redux patterns while maintaining process integrity and stage relationships.
