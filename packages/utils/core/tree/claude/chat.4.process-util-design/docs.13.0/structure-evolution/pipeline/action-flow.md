# Redux Action Flow

## Core Concept

Actions flow through the process pipeline:
- Following Redux patterns
- Maintaining stage context
- Preserving relationships
- Enabling clean composition

## Flow Structure

### Action Path
Actions travel through:
- Stage-aware reducers
- Context boundaries
- State transforms
- Relationship preservers

### State Updates
State evolves through:
- Clean transformations
- Stage-specific changes
- Context maintenance
- Relationship preservation

### Context Flow
Context maintained via:
- Stage awareness
- Scope boundaries
- Tool integration
- Relationship tracking

## Flow Patterns

### Stage-Local Flow
Within single stage:
- Direct reduction
- Clear boundaries
- Fast resolution
- Context isolation

### Cross-Stage Flow
Between stages:
- Controlled transition
- Context transfer
- State migration
- Tool handoff

### Pipeline Integration
System integration:
- Clean composition
- State coherence
- Action coordination
- Tool synchronization

## Key Aspects

1. **Natural Flow**
   - Clear pathways
   - Clean transitions
   - Preserved context
   - Maintained relationships

2. **Stage Awareness**
   - Context boundaries
   - State isolation
   - Action scoping
   - Tool coordination

3. **System Integration**
   - Pipeline coherence
   - Flow control
   - State management
   - Context preservation

The key is that action flow follows natural Redux patterns while maintaining stage awareness and process relationships.
