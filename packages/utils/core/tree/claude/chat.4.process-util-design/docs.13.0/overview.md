# Process System Overview

## Core Concept

A process is fundamentally a composable structure that evolves through stages. The key innovation is enabling natural process composition through operations on their structure, while maintaining stage awareness and clean reducer patterns.

## Key Aspects

### Process Composition
Processes compose through structure operations. Their stage structures can be merged, matched, and transformed while preserving their essential characteristics. This composition happens through well-defined profiles that determine how stages and their artifacts combine.

### Structure Evolution
Each process evolves through stages that form a natural scope hierarchy. The stage structure translates cleanly to a proto chain, enabling natural visibility and composition. Each stage builds specific artifacts (like JSX) that flow through the process evolution.

### Reducer Patterns
Reducers bundle state and actions into composable units of functionality. These units are stage-aware, combining naturally through the process structure. The Redux pipeline provides clean state evolution while maintaining stage boundaries.

## Design Philosophy

1. **Natural Composition**
   - Processes should compose cleanly through their structure
   - Stage merging should follow intuitive patterns
   - Artifacts should flow naturally between stages

2. **Clear Evolution**
   - Stages form natural scopes
   - Structure translates cleanly between representations
   - State and actions evolve coherently

3. **Functional Units**
   - Reducers bundle related functionality
   - State and actions compose together
   - Stage awareness preserved through composition

## Key Benefits

1. **Clean Composition**
   - Natural process merging
   - Intuitive stage combination
   - Clear artifact flow

2. **Flexible Evolution**
   - Natural stage progression
   - Clear scope boundaries
   - Preserved relationships

3. **Coherent Functionality**
   - Bundled state/actions
   - Stage-aware operations
   - Clean reducer composition

## Document Structure

The documentation is organized into three main vectors:

1. **Process Composition Vector**
   - How processes compose through structure
   - Stage matching and merging patterns
   - Artifact preservation through composition

2. **Structure Evolution Vector**
   - Stage and scope patterns
   - Proto chain architecture
   - Translation between representations

3. **Reducer Pattern Vector**
   - State/action bundling
   - Pipeline integration
   - Stage-aware reduction

Each vector's documentation provides detailed exploration of its concepts and patterns.
