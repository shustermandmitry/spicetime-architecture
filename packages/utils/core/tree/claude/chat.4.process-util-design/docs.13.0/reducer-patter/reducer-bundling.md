# Reducer Bundling

## Core Concept

Reducers bundle state and actions into composable units that:
- Maintain clear stage context
- Form coherent functionality
- Enable natural composition
- Preserve relationships

## Bundling Structure

### State and Actions
Reducers naturally combine:
- State structure they manage
- Actions that operate on state
- Stage context where they live
- Relationships they maintain

### Stage Awareness
Each reducer knows:
- Its home stage
- Available operations
- Required context
- Tool dependencies

### Composition Units
Reducers form units that:
- Bundle related functionality
- Maintain clear boundaries
- Enable clean composition
- Preserve stage context

## Bundling Patterns

### Functional Units
Reducers group by:
- Related capabilities
- Shared state needs
- Common stage context
- Natural dependencies

### Stage Organization
Reducers organize in stages:
- Stage-specific capabilities
- Local state management
- Tool integration
- Context handling

### Evolution Support
Bundles enable:
- Natural growth
- Clean extension
- Context preservation
- Relationship maintenance

## Key Aspects

1. **Natural Units**
   - Clear boundaries
   - Related functionality
   - Stage awareness
   - Clean composition

2. **State Management**
   - Coherent structure
   - Action bundling
   - Context preservation
   - Relationship care

3. **Stage Integration**
   - Clear context
   - Tool coordination
   - Clean boundaries
   - Natural flow

The key is that reducers bundle functionality into natural units that respect stage boundaries and enable clean composition.
