# Composable Functionality Units

## Core Concept

Reducers form composable units of functionality that:
- Combine state and actions naturally
- Maintain stage awareness when composed
- Preserve relationships during composition
- Enable clean feature building

## Unit Structure 

### Basic Unit
A reducer unit contains:
- State structure definition
- Actions that operate on state
- Stage context binding
- Composition interfaces

### Composition Rules
Units compose following:
- State structures merge cleanly
- Actions maintain context
- Stage awareness preserved
- Relationships respected

### Feature Building
Units enable features through:
- Natural composition
- Clean boundaries
- Clear interfaces
- Maintained context

## Composition Patterns

### Direct Combination
Simple unit merging:
- State structures align
- Actions combine naturally
- Contexts preserved
- Clean interfaces

### Feature Formation
Building larger features:
- Units compose hierarchically
- Relationships maintained
- Interfaces clean
- Context flows properly

### Cross-Stage Units
Composition across stages:
- Clear boundaries
- Proper context flow
- Clean transitions
- Preserved relationships

## Key Aspects

1. **Natural Composition**
   - Units combine cleanly
   - State merges naturally
   - Actions preserve context
   - Clear boundaries

2. **Feature Support**
   - Building blocks for features
   - Clean composition
   - Clear interfaces
   - Maintained relationships

3. **Stage Awareness**
   - Context preservation
   - Proper boundaries
   - Clean transitions
   - Safe composition

The key is that reducer units provide composable building blocks for features while maintaining stage awareness and relationships.
