## prompt 13
lets leave it alone till next chat

lets summarize and collect all docs into that structure like we planned

but add full coverage of domain language creation

and good coverage of composition patterns

and stick to my scope like structure

its important for easy composition syntax

and will save users and ai lots of headach and make usage super natural

if its not convinient, itll doa, and we wasted time

## answer
You're right - we need to organize our documentation to emphasize:

1. Simple scope-based structure that enables natural composition
2. Domain language creation and evolution through the proto chain
3. Composition patterns that feel natural for both users and AI
4. Linguistic patterns that emerge from basic FP composition

Let me confirm the document structure:

1. Overview
2. Detailed Specifications:
    - Process Lifecycle (stages/evolution)
    - Layered Architecture (scope structure)
    - Domain Composition (language merging)
    - Tree Structure (foundation)
    - Stage Operations (stage-specific tools)
    - Runtime Model (execution patterns)

For each of these, we should:
1. Focus on practical usage patterns
2. Show natural composition syntax
3. Demonstrate scope-based structure
4. Include linguistic patterns where relevant

Would you like me to:
1. Create a new overview integrating these priorities
2. Start refining the individual specifications
3. Focus on a particular aspect first?

The key is making sure everything promotes natural, convenient usage.
