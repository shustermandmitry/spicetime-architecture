im evolving our spec
i want usage pattern to be very declarative, to the level of each method, and prop
- if needs to be
- but not, if not desired

the way to accomplish this is
- by using decorators on each method - each decorator specifies a fix. if more then one fix is to be applied,
a sequence of decorators is listed. but when it gets tiring, the user will do the right thing, create his own fix,
composing all those decorators into one
- if decorators can be used on props in this object, inside constructor, then thats is.if not, suggest what else
- so, fix composing func becomes decorate, and producers class where decorators can be used
- no, lets be even more flexible - fix will be same as designed, but we adding decorate, that takes product of fix,
and producers decorated class, where either fixHelpers can be used, or decorators
- fixed classes will have  static objects hanging off their protos - fixHelpers and decorators, 
after decorate was applied
- please, correct me if im not getting mechanics right
- so, heres the pattern - each higher order func, as fix and decorate adds a static object, perhaps a static method that spits out 
that object, or a getter if possible, but its better to be explicit, and have a functional syntax
- so, we talking evolving some proto object, as each evolution layers another static , nigher order func, 
that spits out another object, 
- so, this way, we actually can evolve thru object.create, or using js like class syntax, and not bunch all our duncs into same object, 
but categorizing them into functional areas of concern

so, by now im lost in implementation of this insolence. i see that whole thing can be orchestrated with same syntax of js classes.
I like that syntax. its very explicit and naturally breaks the flow into focused containers, and creates proto chains that reflect
sequence of evolution, recording time, and avoiding circular recursive loops

## claude
I'll help analyze and evolve the HighClass core specification based on your requirements. Let me break this down step by step.

[doc.of_prompt_0.ts](doc.of_prompt_0.ts)

Let me explain the key aspects of this evolved design:

1. Evolution Chain:
- `fix` factory creates a base fixed class with static helpers
- `decorate` factory evolves the fixed class to support method decorators
- Each evolution step adds its own static layer of functionality

2. Usage Flexibility:
- Class-level fixes using the original `fix` factory
- Method-level decorators for fine-grained control
- Ability to compose decorators for custom combinations

3. Prototype Chain Evolution:
- Each transformation creates a new class in the prototype chain
- Evolution sequence is recorded through class inheritance
- Static helpers and decorators are organized by functional area

4. Implementation Pattern:
- Uses class syntax for explicit containment
- Static objects provide utilities at each level
- Maintains functional programming principles while leveraging class organization

The design maintains the original goals while adding:
- Declarative method-level control
- Clear evolution timeline through prototype chain
- Organized functional areas through static layers
- Prevention of circular dependencies

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect or develop specific parts of the implementation further?
