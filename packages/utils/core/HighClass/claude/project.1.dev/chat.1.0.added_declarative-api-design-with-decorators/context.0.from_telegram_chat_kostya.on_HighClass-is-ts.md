his is executable language
12:20 AM
this is completely new way to code
12:21 AM
that destruct at the top ... it destructs from spicetime tree, at his perspective
12:24 AM
and its all done with just a short util, a few scripts, at most just using js built in functionality
12:25 AM
its like less then 1k footprint
12:26 AM
ZERO DEPS
12:26 AM
well, ramda, perhaps, but not really, funcs are so trivial
12:27 AM
and we can pull ramda funcs lazely, so, even less footprint ramda is super efficient and we can use web assembly, and rustify ALL base funcs and later automate rustification of custom extensions itll be really performant, better then node
edited12:27 AM
and pipes come in at later extensions by process util and we off to the races thats procedural semantec lexical universe
12:31 AM
but, do you understand what he said at the end? hes building react components by description that insolence goes into frigging jsx files, and spits out components export const cookedUpComponent=cookUpComponent('.... the story ...')

please no =)

but then, a custom editor window can take even that boilerplate away and do
12:38 AM
but how, it is not valid JS
12:38 AM
Let it be at least valid JS, if not TS
12:39 AM

but how, it is not valid JS
it is, completely valid
12:39 AM
its ts
12:39 AM
// Stage 1 const Button = compose(addStyling, addBehavior, render)(props, theme); // Stage 3 style button with theme then add behavior then render; // Final Form style button then behave then show;
12:39 AM
This one?
12:39 AM
its a bit massaged but hes not too far off theres some minimal boilerplate but a custom editor window can inject scope as local vars and process the text of executable description with cookUIpComponent automatic
12:41 AM
i used to do it in index files but thayts baaaad
12:42 AM
ill get him to tie the lose ends

ts is built in into func chains and linguistic syntax do you speak ts or russian? let me ask you that and how do you keep it type safe? ever thought of that? lingustic structure takes care of all that boilerplate its amazing, but it took billions of years to evolve the hardware, and thousands to finetune practices
12:45 AM
and its not ts that does typechecking itys us, using rules of grammar, when we construct those func chains
12:46 AM
thats why its so light and efficient, doing mind boggling things
12:46 AM
nbut that syntax is optional, and will take development and getting used to, and some work ypu can use full blown ts on it, in any form of boilerwrap you nostalgic about. everything is optional just go ahead and do your good old imports and no one is stopping you
12:49 AM
so, in summary itll take intact ts and tsx files, no problem
12:50 AM
but its power only comes with using automation of spicetime-react-app it automates structure manipulations so syntax works
12:51 AM
theres no configuration ,no version hell, no pain points AT ALL
12:52 AM
just code by descriptions, with ai translating to more structured executable lingo
12:53 AM
b ut itll take many evolutions to take it to full potential and not by us, by community. it wont work otherwise needs a strong ecosystem, of practitioners
12:54 AM
but, thats ok everything is created thru bootstrap. thats how it works, no exception
