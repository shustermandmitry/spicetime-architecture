# HighClass: A Better Way to Build

## What's This All About?

HighClass is a utility that helps you evolve JavaScript classes in a more sensible way. It's part of a bigger picture where we're trying to make web development more honest about what it actually does - bootstrap itself into existence, piece by piece.

## The Big Idea

Every web app is basically bootstrapping itself, habitually and explicitly. Instead of pretending this isn't happening, HighClass embraces it. We provide tools to make this process clear and manageable.

### Core Concepts

1. **Evolution Over Construction**
   - Nothing is built in one go
   - Each stage builds on what came before
   - Past stages get frozen (can't mess with history!)
   - Future stages extend without breaking the past

2. **No More `this` Weirdness**
   - We pass context explicitly as the first argument
   - Clean, predictable, and obvious what's happening
   - Destructure what you need right at the start
   - No more "what is `this` bound to?" puzzles

3. **Time-Aware Building**
   - Past layers are frozen and immutable
   - Present layer is where active work happens
   - Future layer is where we extend
   - Each layer records its moment in evolution

## The Building Blocks

### The `do` Function
- Creates composable actions
- Works in a very thin local context
- Has to be told exactly what to do
- Places results in current context
- Building block for everything else

### The `fix` Function
- Composes transformations
- Built on top of `do`
- Helps evolve classes layer by layer
- Preserves the chain of context

### Context Awareness
- Each function knows its place in time
- Context flows naturally through composition
- No unexpected binding surprises
- Clear lineage of where things came from

## Why This Matters

Web development is chaos, but it doesn't have to be mysterious chaos. HighClass helps organize this chaos by:
- Making evolution explicit
- Preserving history
- Preventing circular dependencies
- Keeping context clear and predictable

## What's Next?

This is just the foundation. The next step (MiddleClass) will add:
- Linguistic patterns for composition
- Time-aware function binding
- Natural language-like API
- AI-friendly context translation

But first, let's master these basics.
