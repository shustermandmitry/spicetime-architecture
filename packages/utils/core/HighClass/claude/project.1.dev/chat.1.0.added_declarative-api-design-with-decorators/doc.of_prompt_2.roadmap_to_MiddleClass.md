# MiddleClass Development Roadmap

## Overview
MiddleClass extends HighClass with linguistic patterns and temporal context awareness, creating a more expressive composition model.

## Core Features to Develop

### 1. Temporal Binding
- Implement past/present/future context bindings
- Create tense-aware function composition
- Develop temporal perspective shifting

### 2. Linguistic Patterns
- `with/in/from/to` preposition-based argument ordering
- Context-aware verb generation through `do`
- Natural language-inspired function composition

### 3. Advanced Context Management
- Shadow-based context translation between layers
- Automatic context inference from linguistic structure
- Temporal causality preservation

### 4. Function Generation
- Verb creation from composed functions
- Automatic naming based on composition chain
- Context-aware function placement

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Linguistic Framework
- [ ] Preposition handlers
- [ ] Basic tense system
- [ ] Context flow control

### Phase 2: Temporal Mechanics
- [ ] Past/present/future bindings
- [ ] Perspective shifting
- [ ] Causality preservation

### Phase 3: Function Generation
- [ ] Verb generation system
- [ ] Composition-based naming
- [ ] Context placement logic

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] AI-assisted context translation
- [ ] Natural language parsing
- [ ] Semantic validation

## Future Considerations

### AI Integration
- Shadow-based context translation
- Semantic understanding of composition
- Automatic documentation generation

### Language Extensions
- Custom preposition definitions 
- Domain-specific vocabularies
- Semantic validation rules

### Performance Optimization
- Context caching strategies
- Lazy evaluation patterns
- Efficient temporal tracking

## Integration with Existing Systems
