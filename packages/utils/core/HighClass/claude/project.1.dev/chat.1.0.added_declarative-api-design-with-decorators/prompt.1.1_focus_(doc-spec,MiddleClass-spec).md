## me
i wanna talk about api surface of HighClass util. It also generalizes
between all class modding packages. MiddleClass is next one in higher folder scope
thats what that api is
- exposes a single object called highClass. Now, about that object
    * its a class
    * with all our funcs as methods
    * and a static func called getHighClass, and it will have aliases, which are references.
  to same func. 
        - getHighClass, toHighClass, HighClass, makeHighClass
    * here how to make an alias - have one name to be the real def of our func. Then the rest just return 
  its result
    * and the reason we dont do new syntax, theres nothing new under the sun. there are just funcs that 
  keep hatching eggs that hatch chickens, and no one knows where it started from, and thats not new.
    * HighClass is not built in one stage. It is bootstrapped, thru many evolutions, bootstrapping itself
  into existense, extending itself to next stage, and using funcs it built in previous stages.

  Note: section below, use for overview/motivation in the spec
    * This is to make sure, theres no circular deps.and thats the pattern thru entire spicetime, cos entire
  spicetime is built on that foundation, using syntax we are creating here. and entire spicetime process, 
  and anything that uses it as a dep, will be bootstrapping themselves, habitually, and explicitly. 
  and they better get used to it, for its super hard to keep track of, but thats what spicetime is for.
  in shorty, might as well be honest about what any web dev does, and use spicetime as framework, 
  to organize chaos of creation.
    * for this intent, to become reality, that HighClass, exposed by highClass util, has to be a bit 
  peculiar. just one of the first decorators it creates, then composes into every other. its called bind,
  aliased as bound, locallyBound, withContext. just say bind is not enough. need to know to what,
  the normal pattern, everyone assumes, is current context, the this object. This defeats the purpose i stated, 
  and is a very weird way to bind funcs, out of their context, and very brittle. It should not be done routinely,
  for it can create a huge cognitive load, but if someone wants to try, we can have lexicallyBound, 
  aliased as withLocalContext. Im deliberately making it longer, and not default bind, to discourage its use
    * you prbly started to get a clue, we building an executable langauge, using fp patterns, implemented with 
  custom classes. and thats a universal pattern, in all utils, each just extends on class returned by its dep.
  Layering its own dialect, on top of all its deps.
    * Laiter, react components will be doing same, but the object they extend will be their state/rreducer funcs.
  yes, they will leave in the same object, and the difference will be obvious, for first kind is nowns and the other is
  verbs, and they compose into legit sentences, and essays, and recipes and descriptions, and queries and specs,
  and white papers, and it all gets executed wholesale, and operates on the state/itself. And that layering
  of protos will ensure theres no loops in there, adding, basically tics of time, delay, between looping deps.
  and thats a mechanism of introducing promises. rather then explicit and kinda wierd promise chaines, and
  awaits and asyncs, we use our inheritance patterns. 
      * How? - by using tenses. Tenses are just changes in perspective, in temporal direction, and that has
  everything to do with what we bing those funcs with. future can be represented by, actually, the current layer
  , the this object, but we pretend like perspective is one layer below, the present. And anything bound
  to below that in proto chain, is in the past. So, if i say  Find my glasses with your found glasses
  that would be, from default perspective, the current future layer, 

        - const foundGlasses=locallyBound(find)(compose(posessive,claude)(glasses))
        - return compose(await claude,find,with(foundGlasses))(compose(posessive,me)(glasses))
    
      * im getting lost in this, but you can see how binding changes temporal perspective, and we can
      construct tenses using bindings to different protos.
      * and you can see how we use awaits, dictated by linguistic structure, to guard against recursive
      infinite loops, by waiting till context changes
      * all this is in the future iterations of HighClass, maybe MiddleClass
      * so lets put it ain a separate vector - MiddleClass vector, to ship it as context to that future 
      package and project
      * for now, in HighClass, we will do justy the normal js pattern od asyncs and awaits, in non 
      linguistic setting, if we have to
      * but note in that MiddleClass spec vector, that localBind is alias to past and lexical is future,
      and present is bound to immidiate proto below, parent. We looking from perspective of future, into 
      present, and beyond to the past
    * one more important decorator, frozen. That applies to an object.
  it does a shallow freeze. this is important cos HighClass always freezes the proto being extended, 
  so no new props can be inserted, for obvious reasons. i think it might be analogous with protected,
  but applies only to object, and not in the same layer as protected. you figure it out
    *  but we need protected and private as well
    * and we need a way to decorate entire class, so we dont repeat same decorator on each method
    * basically, we need all the machinery of OOP, like c++, all their decorators, as a good start.
  then we can start aliasing as abstractions build layer by layer
    * this is , not just this package, an abstraction translating machine. it morphs and relates and translates abstractions
  and thats just what human language does, and by following kinguistics lead, we are in good hands.
  thats structure that specifically evolved to do precisely that.
    

## so, the steges of HighClass evolution, in exact sequence
- first, we need to create decorator funcs themselves
- along with composing funcs like fix and extendSelf, and all its aliases. you take a guess what they are.
- freeze, bind and all its variants
- a way to decorate entire class, everything in its current layer, a shallow mapping decorator
remember, we never monkey with the past. its frozen anyway

## claude
I'll help evolve our HighClass specification further based on your detailed requirements, 
particularly focusing on the bootstrap process and linguistic patterns.

[doc.of_prompt_1.api-surface.ts](doc.of_prompt_1.api-surface.ts)

This evolved specification introduces several key concepts:

1. Bootstrap Process:
- Stage 1: Core decorators (bind variants, frozen, protected)
- Stage 2: Composers (fix/extendSelf, compose, shallowMap)
- Stage 3: Binding layer with temporal semantics
- Stage 4: Full HighClass API surface

2. Binding Variants:
- `bound/locallyBound` - Default present context binding
- `lexicallyBound` - Future context (deliberately verbose to discourage overuse)
- All with semantic aliases for clear intent

3. Temporal Perspective:
- Future layer: Current instance
- Present: Immediate prototype
- Past: Lower prototype chain (frozen)

4. Core Principles:
- Freezing of prototype chain during evolution
- Clear semantic aliases
- Composition over inheritance
- Prevention of circular dependencies through temporal layering

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect or develop the bootstrap process further?

we put funcs in each layer that have an easy to follow dep structure, composition chains, or composing only out 
of funcs in the past. then we extend, and use them as composing peices. thats the pattern of any bootstrap process
  
note: plz use some of my language, to liven it up, just where appropriate, not too much insolence
