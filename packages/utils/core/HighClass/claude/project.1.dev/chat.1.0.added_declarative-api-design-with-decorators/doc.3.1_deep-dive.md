# HighClass: The Deep Dive

## The Bootstrap Process

HighClass doesn't just appear fully formed - it bootstraps itself into existence through several stages:

### Stage 1: Core Operations
```javascript
// The base 'do' function - works in almost a vacuum
const do_ = (context) => (...fns) => {
  // Compose with explicit context
  return composed;
};
```

This is where it all starts. `do` is our most primitive operation, working with very thin context. It has to be told exactly what to do, but that's good - it keeps things clear and predictable.

### Stage 2: Building the Builder
```javascript
// Fix evolves using do
const fix = (context) => (...transforms) => {
  // Uses do to compose transformations
  return transformed;
};
```

`fix` is built on top of `do`, adding the ability to evolve classes layer by layer. Each layer preserves its context awareness - that's causality at work!

### Stage 3: The Full Package
```javascript
class HighClass {
  // Manages evolution and context
  extend(newContext) { /* ... */ }
  transform(...fns) { /* ... */ }
}
```

The final form, but even this is ready for future evolution.

## Why This Approach?

### The Context Problem
Instead of the weird `this` binding JavaScript gives us:
```javascript
function weirdThis() {
  console.log(this.what); // Who knows what 'this' is?
}
```

We do:
```javascript
function clearContext(context, ...args) {
  const { what } = context; // Clear what we're using
  console.log(what);        // No surprises
}
```

### The Time Problem
Every change in software happens in time. Instead of pretending otherwise, we make it explicit:
- Past layers are frozen
- Present layer is where we work
- Future layer is where we extend

This prevents circular dependencies naturally - you can't depend on something that hasn't happened yet!

## Pattern Examples

### Basic Evolution
```javascript
const base = HighClass.make(baseContext)
  .extend({
    newStuff: (context, args) => /* ... */
  });
```

### Composition with Context
```javascript
const process = do_(context)(
  (ctx, data) => validate(ctx, data),
  (ctx, data) => transform(ctx, data)
);
```

### Freezing History
```javascript
const evolvedClass = base
  .transform(decorators.frozen)
  .extend(newContext);
```

## Looking Forward

This is just the beginning. The next stage (MiddleClass) will add linguistic patterns that make this even more powerful:
- Natural prepositions for argument flow
- Time-aware bindings
- AI-friendly context translation

But that's for another chapter. First, get comfortable with these patterns - they're the foundation everything else builds on.

## Final Thoughts

Remember:
- Each evolution preserves its history
- Context flows explicitly and predictably
- Time is part of your program's structure
- Build in layers, each extending the last

This isn't just another class utility - it's a way to make the natural evolution of software explicit and manageable.
