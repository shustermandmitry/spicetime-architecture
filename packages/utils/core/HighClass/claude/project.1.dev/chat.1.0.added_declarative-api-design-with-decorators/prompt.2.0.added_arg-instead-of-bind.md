lets change the spec
we not using bind func, and that weird this syntax
primarily, cos its a bit more efficient to destruct right out of func arg
, on first line of code in a script. Neat and declarative. 
No this, no import. Done.

so, we passing context, the self, the this, as first argument

## lets work on our linguistics
so, some helper thingy should indicat an arg injection, like in ,with, on
language structure does not imply sequence of args thou, unless we say, fristly, and secondly
but thats not a good pattern in each sentence, and it should be infered, if in past, that means locallyBound
btw, leave previous design, in last prompt, intact.
just another option
and lets make in imply temporal connection, and indicating what to pass as first arg
but that clashes with in room, in past
perhaps, let it be, the way english wants to be. 
That simply means, people like their choice of arg sequence
so, lets just feed them in order specified by sequence of with and ins
but theres one way to fix order, by to and from
ghost from  the past - we are accessing a getter func, or state by some specialized func that fetches it, and 
from means first arg, and past means what arg it is, and the ties it the past of current perspective
but again, i want the right way to be default, so we dont have to worry about all those little pests of to and on and 
with right now. thats for later, maybe MiddleClass
so, if tense is not specified, by in past, or from past, and fixing the context arg within the sequence of pesky ins and with ,
we stick context as first arg
if bind decorators are used, we dont pass the context as arg, we could do both, but well be opiniated aboiut that.
if they dont lioke it, extend the lingo with ypur own func definitions
another advantage of this proto chain approach to time, some ai can easily figure out how to translate between 
inerracting layers, by just followng the shadows

lets add 'do' func. thats what will create verbs later. its a generative func
its a compose, as fix, but is defined in the level below fix, and operates almost in a vacuum, with very 
thin local context. that means it has to be supplied with specific args to operate on, thus one has 
to spell out exactly what to do. later, someone can extend it, of course, but well have a straight 
jacket on such a maniac.
all composing funcs, starting with do, will place the composed result as a prop in lexical context.
to be clear, they operate in their local context, but place composed result into current, lexical context.
just use a fat error func, to inject current context. dont even name it, ts will spell it out in func 
type def.
or better yet, make it carry that as an arg
ok, now the punch line. so, it gets to assign a name for the new arrival to the lexicon zoo.
and it gets it from the names of composed funcs, somehow.
i dont wanna wreck my brain on that. thats all in the future extentions
oh, so fix composes itself using do, in the next layer
then, when we ready to extend both do and fix, we can just manipulate their context binding by doing fat errors, 
and injecting one or another context, to preserve that exact contextual awareness which is part of their functionality
actually it should be a patetrn of any extention
we have to be super careful how contexts are shuffled around, but normally, that local binding works universally, 
for every extention preserves the chain of context awareness.
thats causality at work, btw


## lets wrap it up
i think we put enough complexity into poor HighClass
lets finalize, before he falls of the high class thrown

cfreate final snapshot of design spec, that includes all the implementable details from our discussions, here, 
and previous chats, using artifacts they shared
also, separate MiddleClass vector, and make a roadmap doc out of it, specifically to use as context in MiddleClass project
provide another doc with example of usage for each functionality
this will define use cases to test on, and be illustrative

## claude
I'll help create a final snapshot of the HighClass specification based on our discussions, including the new requirements.

- [doc.of_prompt_1.api-surface.ts](doc.of_prompt_1.api-surface.ts)
- [doc.of_prompt_2.roadmap_to_MiddleClass.md](doc.of_prompt_2.roadmap_to_MiddleClass.md)
- [prompt.2.0.added_arg-instead-of-bind.md](prompt.2.0.added_arg-instead-of-bind.md)

The specification has been significantly evolved to focus on:

1. Explicit Context Passing
- No `this` binding
- Context as first argument
- Clean destructuring patterns

2. Core Evolution Chain
- `do_` as base composition primitive
- `fix` built on top of `do_`
- `HighClass` managing evolution

3. Temporal Awareness
- Context inheritance
- Frozen past contexts
- Future extension points

4. Usage Examples
- Comprehensive patterns
- Context evolution
- Complex compositions

The MiddleClass roadmap outlines future extensions for linguistic patterns and advanced context management.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect or develop any part further?
