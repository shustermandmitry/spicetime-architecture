his is a design chat of our dev project

i provided project instructions and context from previous chat

the design is basically complete, as FP inspired system of composable class fixes

we need to streamline it, and include proper typedoc comments, and module files

i want one additional functionality

a fix factory func, that allows creation of custom fix funcs, that are to be composed by fix composer func

we create that first, then use it in thiose HighClass package, to create all fixes provided out of the box

we will have presets of fixes, dedicated to
## claude
I'll help design the specification for extending the HighClass utility with a fix factory and preset system. Let me analyze the current design and propose the extension.

- [highclass-architecture.mermaid](doc.0.0.architecture.mermaid)
- [highclass-spec.md](doc.0.1.spec)

I've created two artifacts:
1. A Mermaid diagram showing the high-level architecture of the enhanced HighClass system
2. A detailed specification document outlining the extension design

The specification introduces:
- A flexible fix factory system for creating custom fixes
- A structured preset system for common use cases
- Clear extension points for customization
- Comprehensive type definitions
- Module organization
- Testing strategy

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of the design? I can also help break this 
down into more focused documentation pieces for the next phase.

I have to backtrack
this is a core util
means we not gonna have deps
and having trees of presets and fixes has to use tree core util
so we gonna leave that functionality for higher scope util called MiddleClass
Of course we will have a LowClass, thats prbly something that fixes functional 
equevalent of classes - func factories, the most generec, no class approach

so, in HighClass, we are fixing the js native class only
we will create a preset for that, full of fixes for all broken places in js class definition 
then, as need arises, we will be creating new packages generating other presets, for some specific
context
thatll lead to MiddleClass

## claude
Ah, I understand - let's refocus the design to be a lean core utility specifically for fixing JavaScript native class behaviors. You're right that this should be dependency-free and focused on the fundamentals.

- [doc.1.0.md.mermaid](doc.1.0.md.mermaid)
- [doc.1.1.restructured_as_core-util.md](doc.1.1.restructured_as_core-util.md)

I've revised the design to focus purely on the core functionality:

1. A simple fix factory system for creating class transformations
2. A minimal set of built-in fixes targeting specific JS class issues
3. A straightforward composition utility
4. Zero dependencies

Key differences from the previous design:
- Removed preset system (moved to MiddleClass)
- Removed complex configuration options
- Focused only on JS native class fixes
- Simplified module structure
- Minimalist API surface

The core is now focused solely on fixing JavaScript class behaviors while leaving more complex functionality for higher-level utilities like MiddleClass and LowClass.

Would you like me to detail any specific part of this core design?
