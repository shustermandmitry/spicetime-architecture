## patch -1
iv been working on this prompt
and my ideas evolved and morphed
so i supplied the whole sequence of development
the supplied context should be treated as temporal sequence of patches
each patch should be broken into focus vectors, in as granular way as possibly can make sense
while each imbedding having some relevance to our package design
and internal meaning
not all features described will be part of this package
as this is just the first phase of evolution
well decide what is included later, one imbedding at a time"
but we are building just the base of domainTree
note that im changing lifeTree name to domainTree, 
youll find definition later in my convo with kostya

then, treat those imbeddings as props in a scope
we gonna eat our own dogfood here
the names should persist, adding new patchers to each embedding/vector sequence thru time
at the end, create a snapshot summary of each embedding
suggest on which ones to be part of this package
the rest will be road map items, for Middle and Low class

the stuff from kostya has precedence over first patch, as iv developed my thoghts much more clearly, and some contradict with tic 1.
so, if any conflicts, give preference to patch 1, 
same goes for the following patch

if it makes to add new vectors to following patches, plz do
all patches will persist thru stack of extensions
we doing Object,create on previous patch, and freezing each patch as we advance, so no vector can dissapper,
but can be shadowd by namesake
