# patch 2
## i will finalize my thoughts
this will tie it all together. 
- the material in prev patches is mostly valid
- there are some rotten spots - need to be tossed, if contradict with following poatches, especially this one
- this patch will provide the bigger scope context - to properly place HighClass within it


## lets consider where highClass fits in spicetime landscape
the whole thing is a tree
- we start at the root - the tree package
- it creates and exposes Tree class - just a base js class named Tree

## tree util API
this is api of tree-util package, a core util
- treeInstance=Tree.grow(value) 
- treeInstance grows value fruits on branches
- branch=treeInstance.growBranch()
