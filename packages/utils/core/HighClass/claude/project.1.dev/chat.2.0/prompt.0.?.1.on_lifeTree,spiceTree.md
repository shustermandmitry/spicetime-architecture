## thats huge upside potential
- super efficient
- AI-less knowledge banks
    - living in mongo
    - or graph db
    - or all three - mongo,graph, vector

## AI ready
- but optional - just hydrate with some AI service
- common api - just as described
- privacy addressed  - thru nonenumerable props

## money channels
- built in by design - in a base proto layer
- smart contracts - just side effect resolvers, connected to solidity contracts on bc
- but can be anything - just stripe interface, or some escrow service,
  or a composed combo of all three funcs
## so, this is it
a complete strategy
- just start layering up modules - in some sane way of bootstrap
- but not too much of a headache - anything that works is kosher
## version control
- change in a base rusted func , code - new patch, of all downstream funcs
- change in structure of composed funcs - minor change in downstream
- change of func name - major change in downstream

## Major change should never happened
- meaning nothing can ever break - effected by aliasing mechanism
- search for aliases - is automated

## what are aliases
JavaScript


class ClasslessSociety {
find$free$food(context){....}
get$your$share$of$the$pie({find$free$food:freeby,future,reflex}){
return reflex(future,freeby)
}
}

better:

get$your$share$of$the$pie({find$free$food:freeby,future,alias}){
return alias([future,freeby],'homeDelivery')
}
}

### Note:
thats a complicated use of alias func
- normally, it would alias one var name directly to another
- thats good practice

above is misuse, and obfuscation of intent - but so is nature of communism
- good practice - is no composition inside dictionaries. thats what aliasing tables /objects are, abstraction translators, a shallow object
- we can put safeguards into alias func - against some aholes roping people into communism

## is it a recipe for communism?
not unless you actually say 'homeDelivery' into your phone
## and thats how interpreters and cross interpreters are built
- organically - as needed and makes sense
- by each practitioner
- passed over and extended
- by anyone, who values knowledge, encapsulated in the dep
- but needing to ground it to his level
## what are those $ signs everywhere
- we are not greedy.
- these are indicate a carried func - spelling out args it carries
- these form as reflex is envoked - all intermidiate results are dumped into the current context
- why? - so AI can crawl thru it, and compose, by taking dollar signs out,
  and creating meaningful names for resulting func chains

## how time goes to space
i just described it
- AI finds those dollar studded perls of self contained meaning
- perhaps, combines a few dollar bags, to gain critical mass of informational coherence, measured by some tensor transform of vectors, od imbeddings, which are those names with dollars in them
- but no tensor math is needed - just stick a dimension in AI model, and add additional error func, to backprop

## what is that dimension and what optimization goal generates that error
- dimension is a measure of vector coherence, for each dollared imbedding
- not of entire vector - but only part of vector that relevant to selected, infered focuses. Prbly all other dimensions, except the introspection ones
- so, we are calculating how close, in direction, a vector for each imbedding, to each of imbeddings, that are description of a focus of interest, for the person
- i think that has to do with some cross dot products, but claude knows the details, i bet
- and error signal - has to be maximizing degrees of freedom, meaning least amount of deps between funcs, the depth of deps
- no, rather some predetermined goal of a mass of deps, for thats what mass odf a package is, its footprint
- we dont want footprints too big or too small. for obvious reasons
- and ai keeps the choices on a sane track, aggregating deps into nodes of meaning

# !!!! AND THAT, folks, HOW SPACE NODES ARE CRETED
- out of time sequences - which are those funcs, carried away by promises of $ signs
- into nodes of meaning - that have nothing to do with $$$
- but - it all starts with $$$, for it tics the time - $ talks, time listens, time goes to space, when it starts making $ sense

## Thats in economic context
- However, anything can be translated back and forth, by some matrix transform, using those alias tables
- SO, money is a good universal scalar domain
- which is mass
- and therefor gravity
- which proves - einstein was a capitalist
  why?
  ai already trained on all the patterns
  i just ask it to spit it out
  and thats initial patterns of composition
  tyhen the optimization i outlined above, kicks in

do you understand what that is?
thats that pipeline optimization i was talking about
only implementation is dead straigtforward, and no pipelines are necessary. they are useful, for injecting state control from outside enteties, but get dissolved for optimization purposes, into the bulk of time
## so, pipelines
- every node of space - is a func compositional chain
- these funcs are its state - verbs are reducers, nouns are state
- additional reducers are added, to orchestrate hidden meanings
- they all orchestrated by reduxy hook in react, as per compound component, which is node of space
- and thats where pipes come from, and agregate , but only numerable funcs in it, to the top scope, the grand grand grandfarther, CLOCK
- yep, that the bottom proto, i guess, or close to it
- so, wanna change the universe - talk to Clock, thru its pipeline
- wanna change the world - talk to Clock child called planetEarth, thru its pipeline

listen, pipeline is just a func, a prop that gets shadowed by each layer, representing node border
its as dumb as it can get
- its a frigging tree - a treenity instance. Or, rather, interconnected instances, on some basic layer
- but a solid instance, on top level that react components see
- except, they only get limited perspective of the local node they belong
  to
- they are all bunched up into the same object, but layered up, representing stages of the process , of the org they belong to
- and on top level, all you see is a composed func, which is a clean name of an org, a react component with state and logic and peipes and reducers, all machinery, al;l expressed as a branching js object, a jsx string

# AND THEY ALL MAKE LINGUISTIC SENSE
just say 'IRS, give my money back' and it gets done, or you get thrown in jail, as a side effect
actually, you can get in big trouble, for just blabbing to your phone
again, same patternas human brain
we gotta have some filter on our thoughts, and pants on our ugly asses, so we dont emmm ..., bare ass ourselves
its gotta have some filters, or some mechanism of interactions, for irreversable and cosequantial side effect actions
My pan flute
I’m figuring how to play it
You just blow into holes
And turn reverb up
And it sounds very Andean
i dont think you follow the concept
theres NO ai involved at run time
ZERO
it just executes fp chains
all prearranged, at build stage
then, ai can have a role, but humans do that just fine
theres practically little need for ai
itll do just fine wo it

their might be some ast parsers involved, to interpret most convoluted speach patterns, and ai might have a role in picking up those patterns and building interpreter structure
to convert to simpler meanings, compositions
hmmm
looking at that pic
same can be done for music
why not
its a lingo
very structured
and musicians can compose it just fine
it can be an ultimate synthesizer/mixer
i bet, music has exactly same linguistic structure
its the same brain that interprets it
it uses same circuitry
I would, for sure
i think sense of tempo, drum beat, has to do with temporal perception
i can almost structure it
but got other things to worry about
still, a cool problem to solve
