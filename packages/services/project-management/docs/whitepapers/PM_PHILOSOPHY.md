# Project Management Philosophy

## Core Principles

1. **Causality First**
   - Project relationships create causality
   - Events flow through causal chains
   - State changes respect causal order

2. **Resource Focus**
   - Resources define project boundaries
   - Allocation drives decisions
   - Tracking maintains accountability

3. **Distributed Reality**
   - No global state
   - Local truth with synchronization
   - Event-based coordination

## Evolution Path

The PM service evolves naturally into SpiceTime Runtime by solving real project management problems in a principled way. Each feature adds capabilities that benefit the entire ecosystem:

1. Resource allocation → General resource management
2. Task scheduling → Distributed process scheduling
3. Project events → System-wide event propagation
4. NextCloud integration → General tool integration

## Implementation Philosophy

1. **Clean Functional Core**
   - Pure functions where possible
   - Clear effects boundaries
   - Composable operations

2. **Event-Driven Integration**
   - Events for integration
   - Subscriptions for coordination
   - Promise-based resolution

3. **Practical Focus**
   - Solve real PM problems
   - Enable natural evolution
   - Maintain simplicity
