## 5. Scripts Reference

- **Generate All**:
  ```bash
  npm run generate-all
  ```
- **Docs Only**:
  ```bash
  npm run generate-docs
  ```
- **Types Only**:
  ```bash
  npm run generate-types
  ```

By following this setup, the schema remains the single source of truth while documentation and code are always in sync.
