# Context Manager

## Abstract

The "context-manager" package provides seamless handling of MongoDB connections, user authentication via JWT tokens, and context building for GraphQL or REST APIs.

## Motivation

Designed to ensure every service in the monorepo can efficiently handle authenticated and database-connected requests.

## Roadmap

1. Extend hooks to support Redis or local mem-cache.
2. Replace MongoClient singletons with pools for high-throughput APIs.

## Integration
Exported via `@org/context-manager`.
