first of all, we need to be testing implementation itself

we need to specify, thru tests, how things evolve, by inheritance, by mixing, by chaining. you did do a chain test

but it has to be extended, to narrow down the range of possible result variants, like an extended object with proto, 
or extended class, or the same object, just checking by reference, not equality

your difficulty is in generalizing over js primitives

js did not do that, we should not either

we have objects,funcs,arrays,numbers and strings,maps

so, we should have primitive trees, each with its own set of ops in evolve arsenal

evolve is compose in ramda-speak

so, lets overload tree with compose and evolve, identical funcs

so, our tree starts with a seed

thats the proto of the tree object

evolve is a static, that is used to evolve seed, into instance of a tree, with Object.create

but before that, we evolve seed proto, which is not type of value aware, into its js primitive specific trees

that seed proto provides just a backborn of high order funcs, ramda funcs, that work on any type of value

then primitive specific trees extend that proto seed into number seed and object seed and so on

seed is a tree wo root, no value

again, we should have overload on root, as value

then, each branch is a tree, with a root, its value,

a branch is extention of its parent branch/tree

and should have a reference to parent, which is overload for proto

what we doing is creating an abstraction dictionary with those overloads, in. a methodical way

like doing abstraction transform

we should make it explicit, with an abstraction map in each entity we are dealing with

and its translating terms between its parent and self

like a spec

then overloads ,make sure its implemented, but most of the time, its done thru renaming old funcs or props, in proto extention

this functionality should be in seed proto

then proceed the seed to to its primitive type variants

actually, thats THE mechanism of overloading

so, everuything is an object, numbers and arrays as well.js does it. its legit

we dont have pure non object numbers, or strings, or funcs

so, seed proto is an object seed, to start with

so, lets call it that, objSeed

and its got a termTransform prop, with self:[Seed,objSeed]

that means that its kids can call it Seed, as well as objSeed

its aka,nickname

and its a pattern

of aliases

so termTransform has a proto, and a self:[termTransform,aliases]

so, aliases are very useful

now we have a way to relate kids to parents, and end generation gap issues

eventually, itll get overloaded up into a rust implemented zoo of interpreters, complete with run times, creating domain specific  syntactic lingos

that will give us ability to create executable trees, and be generative to spoken words

well have to start splitting all this into modules, each with its own test

lets keep all scripts in same flat folder, for now,

tests and modules and type files will be there as well

so, keep that in mind on imports

we will write our tests first, then update docs in the design chat

and thats a general pattern,  prelim design first

prelim tests, evolve tests to finals, generate final design docs,

implement and pass the tests, repeat for any new insights,

## evolve is a static, or stand alone func

it simply does Object.create

it should be in a separate module

and thats the proto seed,or one of funcs in there
## think what life does, at its basic
it reproducers, so branch
it evolves, so evolves
it ends, so prune, or archive
but we can add the third one later

then helper funcs, like pipe, and event/messaging system
and aliases 

lets move on
fossilSeed, protoSeed (reflected im aliases as self:[fossilSeed]),  will evolve into objSeed,Seed
that one will arm its evolve, the static member, with object manipulation tools, ramda style 
then, we evolve it, or the fossilSeed, or a mixin, to the rest of seed primitives, the fossilSeedBank
thats another tree domain, of seedBank, that travels with seeds, popinting to the seedBank they belong to
ARe you getting pattern?
we throwing all these things together, into each evolution of seed
and its about to start growing into a tree
So, next , seeds, all of them, start evolving to a tree of its kind
objSeed becomes objTree, aka Tree
and so on
but we do mixins, to give other tree primitives ability to evolve themselves
and thats the end of the beginning
thats all our tree util shoiuld provide
the rest is up to the gardener community, of utils and components

so, to recap
each primitive tree will have
branch
leaf
pipe
evolve; chain, extend, inherit, as appropriate by its type
theres a notion of life stages, but its just a notion
in reality, theres just time tics, represented by sequence of protos
so, anyone wants to monkey with fossils, can create another tree primitives and start growing his own majic forrest, by evolving evolve itself
thaty would be a build stage in some other contexts, and one is process context, but thats for the gardeners, that enjoy composing, more thyen gardenoingh

and evolve, will have aliases appropriate to the specie and seed type, and seedBank, and will aquire them as more scopes join the evolved hosts, that use its services, and declare its aliases, in aliases object/scope
scope is just an object full of protos,prototype chain
so, we can name it according to context, and avoid confusion in each context, while not wrecking our head, deciding how contextx will interact and how to chose the right name
for theres no right name
just like anything has aliases, for a reason

## Answer

Let me analyze the requirements and design a core tree utility that focuses on evolution patterns and composition. I'll start by outlining the core concepts and initial test approach.



I've designed a core tree utility that focuses on evolution patterns and composition, following a test-first approach. The key aspects of this design are:

1. **Evolution Model**
- Starts with a basic `fossilSeed` providing core evolution through Object.create
- Extends to `objSeed` with overloaded evolution patterns (transform, extend, mixin, chain)
- Clear testing strategy for each evolution pattern

2. **Primitive Types**
- Each JS primitive gets its own specialized tree type
- Type-specific operations built on core evolution patterns
- Proper prototype chain maintenance
- Alias system for flexible naming

3. **Composition Patterns**
- Branch creation with parent references
- Pipeline composition for multiple transforms
- Evolution tracking through prototype chain

4. **Testing Strategy**
- Test-first development for all features
- Verification of evolution patterns
- Type-specific behavior testing
- Composition pattern validation

Would you like me to focus on any particular aspect of this design, such as:
1. Expanding the test coverage for specific patterns
2. Detailing the implementation of additional primitive types
3. Exploring more complex composition scenarios
4. Defining additional evolution patterns

The current design provides a foundation that can be evolved based on specific needs while maintaining clean composition patterns and type safety.

## prompt 1
- on aliases
its an object
translates between terms in parent to current context
it has a notion of self, as current context projects outward
and it has current context section, where it overloads certain local terms/funcs/props
that is implemented by a serious of extentions(inherited thru object.create, bothy the aliases object, and itys host object)
Precizely to avoid formation of arrays, for each term being translated/aliased
so, theres always one to one correspondence in aliases
and each extension is for some specific context, or subcontext of the host
so, a context prop can be provided, but optional, its of any type, and is shadowed by extentions, 
but can be aliased, to be able to create context cliusters, windows of context,vector spreads
- i dont like evolve implementation
it lacks uniformity
- objects are the interface to funcs, tho funcs are primary
evrything ends up in some func being executed
objects might represent a state, props, or a some other attrinbutes of a func
and though evolve is an object, value func has all kinda obfuscated candelibre hanging off it
- and worst, it says, im a value prop, and then attacks you as a func. if you want a prop that is reactive, make it a getter, or setter 
- besides, fossilSeed has no notion of value yet 
for its typeless, where value must be typed
- but it does have a sense of self
so it evolves itself, in build stage, of iyts timeline

## we will be using the best fp practices
this is how we type carry func
```ts
// Support partial application
type CurryPartial<P extends any[], R> =
  <T extends Partial<P>>(...args: T) =>
    T extends P ? R :
    CurryPartial<Extract<P, Exclude<P, T>>, R>;
```
## action functions
- these are pure funcs that do the work
- theres a set of actions at each stage, as described below
they are 
## lifeStages
each generation of a tree, from fossil to beyond, will have a scope like object lifeStages
with each generation, its extended and new stages might be added
as in any scope, name clashes can be mitigated by aliasing, in the self section, in this case
each lifeStage prop is an object with all actions can be done while in that stage

```ts
interface lifeStage {
    :{
        evolve:action
    },
    run
}
```
## take a look at new context
it might shed light how i plan to implement reality
it has direct impact on our design
especially fp patterns of state management im proposing
thats why we doing object.create everywhere we turn
that evolution is tics of toime
we not doing it here, but thats what it will have to be, what else
