## prompt
lets take a look at branch.giveSeed func

its a pure func, its being fed args in corrct sequence, with name first, then the state to operate on

but what kinda state it should be given 

each of your funcs has a different state, and thats aweful confusing, and crates a zoo of func types 
and all associated ts boilerplate. its a nightmare, waiting to happen

lets just give each action func the same state, the entire domainScope, which is that object, a collection of all treeScopes, in the top level of the forrest, of that domain. like webDev domain
its one tree, split into all other trees, off the same root

and in that root sits that shiny object, with api for each package, supplied by each package, to the root 

and normallyu, we would have there reducers and data thsoe reducers operate on, redux style

note, those scopes in that domainScope are instances of tree

and tree is something much simpler then what im describing, which is implementation of domains
each domain has all kinds of trees, the forrest

btw, all interpreters translate to common lingo, the webDev lingo, using webDev terms and concepts

and their runtimes operate as webDev runtime, using the same runtime everywhere, but doing different 
funcs in context of domain, composing what webDevs woulkd do

so, on reducers and data
we have a dep called TreeRPC that makes such structures , as trees reactive. 

we will be relying on its api to do many things in opur design, of  domain process and structure

so, those reducers and data will be combined, to become exetable data structure. that would greatly reduce the cognitive load on devs

what we need is api surfaces to integrate with TreeRPC and between all the peices of domain design

these surfaces should be gql like executable schemas, prbly subset of an executable tree of each package

note how i said executable tree

that means next evolution of that tree package,the executable tree, we are designing here, in abscense of api for TreeRPC.
but we can take a guess, and prbly be not too far off.

tyhe only functionality remains to be speched is semver and dependance management,of all these internal packages

well do that later. for now, lets create design of that domain package, based on simple tree package and executable tree package, and process 
package and whatever else makes sense to split off

each will have an api as i described

## answer
Ah, this is a crucial insight! Let me revise the design to have a consistent state type (domainScope) that holds the entire forest for a domain, and integrate it with the concept of executable trees.

[doc.7.domain-forest,tree-api-with-executable-schema.ts](doc.6.domain-forest%2Ctree-api-with-executable-schema.ts)

Key changes in this design:

1. Consistent State Type:
```typescript
// Every function gets the same state type
type DomainScope = {
  root: Tree;
  trees: Map<string, Tree>;
  api: ExecutableSchema;
  interpreters: Map<string, Interpreter>;
};
```

2. Executable Schema Preparation:
```typescript
type ExecutableSchema = {
  reducers: Map<string, Function>;
  data: any;
  // Ready for TreeRPC integration
};
```

3. Interpreters All Use WebDev Language:
```typescript
type Interpreter = {
  translate: (code: string) => string;  // To webDev
  runtime: (state: DomainScope) => any; // In webDev context
};
```

4. Simplified Tree Structure:
```typescript
type Tree = {
  id: string;
  value: any;
  branches: Map<string, Tree>;
};
```

Would you like me to:
1. Detail the TreeRPC integration points?
2. Expand the executable schema structure?
3. Add more sophisticated interpreter patterns?
4. Something else?

I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on how the executable schema should evolve to work with TreeRPC when it's available.
