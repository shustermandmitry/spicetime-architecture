## prompt 

we are utils/core package now so, all util names will not have any st or sta designators its obvious where they are well use this chat to coordinate between core utils we will use incremental approach well start streamligning core utils design in the error util

lets chat about it, no docs till i say so
i want to preserve the path thru my packages as error propagates to the react error bounds
i want the path look readable and consize, and visually pleasing
i know js error object is designed to track in similar way
also, react proviodes additional functionalities
but they dont know about my folder structure
i treat my components as packages firmly placed in structure,
they can be dynamicaly moved, but under react control, as an orchestrated process
so, their location in my structure is important and itll be easier to debug with knowledge of error location in my structure

I understand. You want error traceability that's structure-aware and integrates nicely with both the JavaScript error system and React error boundaries, while being visually appealing and containing package/component location information.

Some key aspects to consider:

1. The error propagation path should reflect your hierarchical package/component structure
2. Errors need to carry location context from where they originated in your structure
3. The format should be easily consumable by React error boundaries
4. Visual presentation should be clean and helpful for debugging

A few questions to help shape the design:

1. Should we extend the native Error class directly or create our own base error class that wraps it?
2. For package location tracking - would you prefer absolute paths from repo root or relative paths from current package?
3. How granular should the location information be? Just package level or down to specific files/functions?
4. Do you want to track the component hierarchy path when errors propagate through React components?

What are your thoughts on these aspects? Understanding your preferences here will help design an error system that fits your needs.
## prompt
react prbly tracks thru jsx string
________________
Yes, React tracks through the component tree as rendered in JSX. This is separate from your package structure that the JSX lives in.

So your error system needs to track:
1. Package location - where the error-generating code lives in your repo structure
2. Let React handle the JSX component tree trace separately

And later, when building React components, you'll use the error boundaries to catch and process these errors, merging both traces:
- Your structural trace shows where in your codebase the error came from
- React's trace shows how it propagated through the rendered component tree

Does this align with your vision? Would you like the error to store both:
1. The path from sta root to package (for structural context)
2. The path within package to exact file (for debugging)

Or would you prefer just one of these levels of granularity? We could also make the granularity configurable.
## prompt 
so, my track thru structure is no differant then js native stack track
________________
Ah, I see - you're absolutely right. The JavaScript native error stack trace already follows the call path through your code structure. So we don't need to replicate that functionality.

What we really need is just to add additional context about:
1. Which domain/package the error originated from
2. Perhaps some custom metadata specific to your architecture

This way we:
- Don't duplicate what JS already does well (stack traces)
- Add only the extra structural context that JS doesn't know about
- Keep it lightweight and compatible with both JS error system and React error boundaries

Does this better match what you're thinking? We could create a base error class that:
1. Extends Error
2. Adds minimal custom fields for your structural context
3. Preserves the native stack trace functionality

Let me know if this realignment makes sense or if you're envisioning something different.
## prompt
yes
we need to add package location data
i want to display package name, version, path to root of repo
also, why not show path from package root including script name, filepath from package root
you know, just ba fileoath from repo root
each package has version embedded in its name, but well display it out of package .json anyway
but, lets not be concern whats in location object
thatll be supplied by a script in scripts util package
i dont see any need to track error propagation to the error boundary
tell me if im wrong

we need to display a compound message string as error propagates thru the stack
each error trap will record its own extension to the msg string, starting with the third party service that threw the error
thatll provide a clear reason , to follow the stack trace
each extension will contain package and script name
thats a trace again, but thru my structure, with my messages
so, lets show an erray of info objects, each with location object and a message
the service that generated will also have its location object
location util will handle that, as part of its api surface
we will design it next
so, our STError class will inherit from native Error
the constructor of each inherited class will take prev error and message
it will access location script to generate an info object and will push it to info array of the new error instance
if itys a thrird party service that thru the error, the error constructor will be called with optional externalSourceName prop
____________________
I understand now. Let me break down the design to make sure I have it right:

1. Base STError class extends Error and maintains:
    - An array of info objects, each containing:
        - location object (provided by location script - we'll design that later)
        - message specific to that stage
    - Original external source info if from 3rd party

2. Flow of error creation/propagation:
   ```typescript
   // 3rd party service throws
   throw new STError("API timeout", {externalSourceName: "AWS Lambda"})
   
   // Your package catches and adds context
   try {
     // ...
   } catch(err) {
     throw new DataProcessingError("Failed to process records", err)
   }
   ```

3. When displayed, you'll see:
    - Full native JS stack trace (unmodified)
    - Your custom trace showing:
        - Original error from external service
        - Each hop through your packages with:
            - Package name/version/location
            - Contextual message added at that stage

4. The location info will be handled by a separate utility (yet to be designed) that provides package paths, versions etc.

Does this capture what you're envisioning? The key insight is that we're not replacing or modifying the native error tracking, 
just adding our own parallel trace that follows the error through your architectural boundaries.
## prompt
lets make it externalSourceInfo:{name,message}


_____________________
Ah yes, better structure. So when creating an error from external source:

```typescript
throw new STError("Failed to process Lambda response", {
  externalSourceInfo: {
    name: "AWS Lambda",
    message: "Timeout after 30s"
  }
})
```

This way the external source info is properly encapsulated with both name and message, giving more complete context about where and how the external error originated.

The info array in the error instance would then contain objects like:
- Source error info (if from external source)
- Each subsequent package's context (location + message)

Does this structure work better? Would you like to explore the shape of any other parts of the error object?

## prompt
- also, its added on the stack in same format, indicating in location data what it is
- lets do a design doc, with api surface
  for each util we will have a cli part of api and an api for run time
  except for error it does not work, just an error factory
  other clis can figure it out
  actually they all use runtime cli, why bother

### doc [doc.for_prompt_0.design.md](doc.for_prompt_0.design.md)

I've created an initial design document for the error utility. The key aspects I focused on:
1. Simple but extensible API
2. Clear type definitions
3. Support for both external and internal errors
4. Custom error type creation
5. Integration with future location utility

Would you like me to adjust any aspects of the design? For example, we could:
1. Add more specific error type factories
2. Expand the location info interface
3. Add more usage examples
4. Detail the implementation approach

Let me know what areas need refinement.
