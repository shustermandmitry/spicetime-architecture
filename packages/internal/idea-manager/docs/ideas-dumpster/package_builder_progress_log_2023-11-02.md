## Summary
This log captures the progress, accomplishments, and pending tasks for the **Package Builder** tool.

## Subjects

### 1. Tooling Setup

**Accomplished:**
- Established the **Package Builder** workflow to dynamically scaffold new npm packages.
- Added support for TypeScript and basic configurations for:
  - Linting (e.g., ESLint, Prettier).
  - Testing (e.g., Jest/Vitest).
  - Common package files (e.g., `package.json`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`).

**Pending:**
- Automate starter templates for:
  - Framework-specific packages (e.g., React, Node.js server utilities).
  - Integration with existing monorepos.
- Allow custom configurations via CLI options (language selection, preferred tools).

### 2. Automation

**Accomplished:**
- Wrote a CLI script to scaffold a new package directory automatically.
- Added runtime checks for essential tools (e.g., Node.js, pnpm).

**Pending:**
- Add extensibility: allow plugins for custom templates.
- Explore GitHub Actions for publishing new packages to npm registry after builds.

## Final Notes
The **Package Builder** is functional but requires additional features and extensibility to support diverse package creation needs. Key next steps include template variations and CI/CD integration.
