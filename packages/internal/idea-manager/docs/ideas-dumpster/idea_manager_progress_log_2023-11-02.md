# Idea Manager Log (2023-11-02)

## Summary
This log captures the progress, accomplishments, and pending tasks regarding the development of the **Idea Manager** project.

---

## Subjects

### 1. Project Setup
**Accomplished:**
- Decided to structure the project as a **Node.js package** called `idea-manager`.
- Created an organized folder structure for:
  - Processing raw ideas from a "dumpster".
  - Archiving processed ideas.
  - Storing and querying data in MongoDB.

**Pending:**
- Finalize decision whether to integrate **Telegram** for managing raw input.
- Explore additional archival options like cloud storage (to avoid GitHub for both the dumpster and archive).

---

### 2. Processing Workflow

**Accomplished:**
- Drafted a `process-notes.js` script to:
  1. Read Markdown files from `docs/ideas-dumpster/`.
  2. Save their content into MongoDB.
  3. Move processed files into `docs/ideas-archive/`.

**Pending:**
- Test the script with sample data to confirm expected functionality.
- Refine error handling: deal with invalid files, duplicates, or conflicts during archival.

---

### 3. Database Setup

**Accomplished:**
- Selected **MongoDB** as the database for storing the processed ideas.
- Established a basic schema for raw notes.

**Pending:**
- Define a schema for structured/processed ideas (including embedding storage and relationship models in the future).
- Ensure robust backups to protect the database from corruption or data loss.

---

### 4. Telegram Integration (Future Feature)

**Pending:**
- Investigate the Telegram Bot API as a frontend for dumping ideas directly into the system.
- Design the workflow for handling Telegram inputs (e.g., categorize input or store as raw notes).

---

## Final Notes
Weâ€™ve laid the groundwork for the **Idea Manager** project with a clear vision for its core functionality and its future extendable capabilities. Next steps include testing, refining the workflow, and incrementally adding optional features like Telegram integration or cloud archival.
