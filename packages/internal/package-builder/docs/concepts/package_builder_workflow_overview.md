# Lifecycle and Workflow of the Package Builder

The **Package Builder** works through the following stages:

1. **Input Gathering**  
The process begins by collecting **input objects**, such as:
   - Abstract descriptions of functionality.
   - High-level specifications, diagrams, or pseudo-code.
   - Design outlines or mockups.
   - Brainstormed ideas (even poorly described ones).

   Example input:
   > “I need a task manager app with a calendar, user auth, and a card-based UI for task tracking.”  

---

2. **Context and State Management**  
The **internal meta-engine** processes these inputs and dynamically builds the **current working state**, which includes:
   - The **data model**, including key entities in the system (e.g., Tasks, Users, Calendar Events).
   - A draft **UI structure** (e.g., React components).
   - **Reusable workflows** for repetitive or generic functionality.

---

3. **Automated Execution**  
The app then **generates fully executable JavaScript code**:
   - UI: React (or another framework).
   - Styles: JSS (or other specified CSS-in-JS solutions).
   - State Management: Context API, Redux, or others.
   - Backend Communication: Auto-generated API connections.

   Example Output in React:
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { createUseStyles } from 'react-jss';

const useStyles = createUseStyles({
  card: { ... },
  taskTitle: { ... },
});

const Task = ({ title, onComplete }) => {
  const classes = useStyles();
  return (
    <div className={classes.card}>
      <p className={classes.taskTitle}>{title}</p>
      <button onClick={onComplete}>Complete</button>
    </div>
  );
};
export default Task;
```

---

4. **Interactive Refinement**  
The developer can refine and iterate **in real-time**:
   - Modify structure: “Add a Notes section to each Task.”
   - Re-generate the code incrementally, instead of starting from scratch.  

---

5. **Deployment-Ready Output**  
After refinement and iteration, the Package Builder composes everything into a **fully deployable app**, including:
   - Functional components.
   - Connected state flows.
   - Unit tests and integration hooks.
