# Philosophy

The Package Builder is built on a set of guiding philosophies:

### 1. Meta-Driven and Context-Aware  
The key to modern app development is **context**. Inputs should not just be treated as static instructions but instead understood in relation to:
- The **environment** in which the app runs.
- The **user intent**, even if it is incomplete or unclear.
- The **context of surrounding systems**, such as APIs, frameworks, and third-party services.  
The Package Builder uses **meta-driven principles** to stay context-aware and evolve along with developer inputs.

### 2. Bridging Ideation and Development  
Often, the space between a messy brainstorming session and actual working code is filled with inefficiencies. Docs are written, rewritten, handed off, and misunderstood. The Package Builder compresses this gap by acting like an **IDE for ideas**—where business logic and features are built dynamically, keeping developers in the flow.

### 3. Automation with Developer-in-the-Loop  
While the Package Builder automates processes, it keeps developers in control:
- Developers refine, enhance, and extend the outputs.  
This “developer-in-the-loop” model fosters collaboration between machine-generated suggestions and human oversight.

### 4. Adapt to Surrounding Contexts Automatically  
Instead of forcing developers to work around **rigid systems**, it adapts to:
- Frameworks like React (but extensible for other frameworks).  
- Existing tools in the ecosystem (e.g., ESLint, built-in testing libraries like Vitest, CI/CD pipelines).
