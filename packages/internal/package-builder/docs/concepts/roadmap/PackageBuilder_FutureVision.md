# Future Vision for Package Builder

This is only the beginning. The Package Builder will eventually support:

1. **Cross-Stack Automation**  
   - Generate backend services alongside frontend code: Express.js, Fastify, or Serverless setups.

2. **Auto-Generated CI/CD Pipelines**  
   - Automate the creation of workflows to test, build, and deploy apps in a modern DevOps environment.

3. **Deeper Framework Integrations**  
   - Storybook, GraphQL Schemas, Gatsby Featuresâ€”pre-built, live-connected boilerplates.

4. **Collaborative Team Mode**  
   - Developers and designers could provide multiple inputs (e.g., Figma files or whiteboard diagrams).
