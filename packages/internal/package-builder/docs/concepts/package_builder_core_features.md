# Features of the Package Builder

### Core Features:
1. **Dynamic Meta-Driven State**  
   - Understands abstract intent and refines it against contextual inputs.

2. **Real-Time Interactivity**  
   - Works like a sandbox: as ideas evolve, the Package Builder evolves too.

3. **Full Lifecycle Management**  
   - Abstract -> Design -> Code Generation -> Deployment.

4. **Flexible Extensibility**  
   - Developers can extend it with their own templates, workflows, or plugins.

5. **Default React Integration**  
   - Uses React for the UI layer (but adaptable to Angular, Vue, etc.).
